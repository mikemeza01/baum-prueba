Hay más correcciones en curso.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>¡Felices pruebas!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>¿Quieres saber las novedades de la<em> version 5.9? Sigue leyendo para conocer algunas de las más destacadas.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"edicion-completa-del-sitio\"><strong>Edición completa del sitio</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"styles-interface\">La interfaz de estilos</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Combina todas las características que se lanzaron en la versión 5.8 con las que harán su entrada en la versión 5.9 y tendrás la&nbsp;<strong>edición completa del sitio.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anteriormente conocidos como estilos globales, la interfaz de estilos te permite interactuar directamente con tus bloques y elementos desde la administración de WordPress. Desde la tipografía a las paletas de color, esta interfaz de diseño uniforme implica que puede haber un cambio de diseño –incluso un cambio radical– sin cambiar de tema. <strong>Sin tener que escribir código</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"theme-json\"><strong>Theme.json</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Presentado en WordPress 5.8, theme.json se ha mejorado para activar características y estilos por defecto para tu sitio y sus bloques. Con la versión 5.9, theme.json puede incluir temas hijos y el tratamiento de duotono. Coordina capas de estilo con theme.json, quitando peso del CSS de tu tema.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otras características admitidas por theme.json incluyen:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Bordes:</strong>&nbsp;Color, estilo y aumento de la propiedad de aumento del borde que apareció en la versión 5.8.</li><li><strong>Diseños flexibles:</strong>&nbsp;Compatibilidad con espacios entre bloques, cortesía de spacing.blockGap.</li><li><strong>Tipografía:</strong>&nbsp;Familias de fuentes, estilo de fuente, peso de fuente, decoración y transformación de texto.</li><li><strong>Imágenes</strong>: Duotonos.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"un-nuevo-bloque-de-navegacion\"><strong>Un nuevo bloque de navegación</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bienvenido al modo más intuitivo de crear una navegación: El bloque de navegación.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aquí están las características que necesitan más pruebas:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Opciones de menú adaptables que puedes desactivar, tener siempre activas u optar por usar solo en pantallas pequeñas.</li><li>Accesibilidad desde el teclado incluida. Por accesiblidad, por velocidad o por ambas cosas.</li><li>Añade bloques adicionales, como los bloques de búsqueda y de icono del sitio (y personalízalos a tu gusto).</li><li>Elementos de submenú con opciones de estilo.</li><li>Alineación horizontal o vertical.</li><li>¿Navegación reutilizable? ¿También al cambiar de tema? Sí. Porque el bloque de navegación que crees se guarda como un tipo de contenido personalizado.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"un-mejor-bloque-de-galeria\">Un mejor bloque de galería</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>¿Qué pasaría si pudieses tratar las imágenes individuales de tu bloque de galería del mismo modo que lo haces con el bloque de imagen? <strong>Ahora puedes hacerlo.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haz que cada imagen de tu galería sea distinta de la siguiente, con recorte interno o un duotono, y cambia diseños con la facilidad de arrastrar y soltar. Con el bloque de galería mejorado, cada imagen es su propio bloque de imagen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Una cosa a tener en cuenta:&nbsp;</strong>¿Has creado un plugin o tema basado en la funcionalidad del bloque de galería?<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/08/20/gallery-block-refactor-dev-note/\">&nbsp;Asegúrate de revisar esta nota de desarrollo, que detalla lo que necesitas para que sea compatible</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"modo-de-concentracion-de-partes-de-plantilla\"><strong>Modo de concentración de partes de plantilla</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Crear partes de plantilla puede requerir un nivel de concentración exclusiva debido a que estás tomando decisiones sobre todo el sitio. Así que WordPress 5.9 añade un modo de concentración que te muestra solo la parte en la que estás trabajando ahora mismo (y del que puedes volver a la visualización normal con solo pulsar una tecla).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"directorio-de-patrones-de-bloques\">Directorio de patrones de bloques</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>El <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">directorio de patrones</a> ofrece una amplia variedad de patrones de bloques, desde un par de bloques que muestran una imagen con texto a diseños de página completa con columnas y secciones. Desde la versión 5.8, el directorio se ha convertido en un centro de exploración de interfaces de usuario y de patrones, aceptando el envío de patrones y ofreciéndolos a la comunidad. Así que ahora tu creación puede ayudar a otras personas a crear su sitio perfecto.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"tema-por-defecto-twenty-twenty-two\">Tema por defecto <strong>Twenty Twenty-Two</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Un modo completamente nuevo de crear temas WordPress.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.9 introduce características que hacen posible la edición completa del sitio, incluyendo <strong>el primer tema por defecto de bloques</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usando un CSS mínimo, los estilos del tema residen en theme.json para que puedas configurarlos en la interfaz de estilos de la administración de WordPress. Haz que este tema adquiera su propia personalidad en todo el sitio, con una amplia gama de esquemas de color, combinaciones de tipografías, plantillas de páginas, componentes prefabricados (formularios) y tratamientos de imágenes entre los que elegir.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"mas-mejoras-y-actualizaciones\"><strong>Más mejoras y actualizaciones</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>¿Te encanta bloguear? Los nuevos retoques al flujo de publicación te permiten añadir nuevas entradas segundos después de pulsar el botón de publicar tu última entrada.</li><li>La visualización de lista te permite arrastrar y soltar contenido tan fácilmente como solías navegar por ella –y contraer secciones enteras– para que puedas concentrarte en una tarea o tener una visión más amplia.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33955\">Los bloques de botones y de iconos sociales ahora absorben</a> y muestran los controles de la barra de herramientas de su bloque superior.  </li><li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43700\">Elige tu idioma</a> en la pantalla de acceso.</li><li>Más <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33868\">mejoras de rendimiento</a> (o sea, velocidad).</li></ul>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://es.wordpress.org/2021/12/06/wordpress-5-9-beta-1/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"\n		\n		\n					\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n					\n			\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"¡Volvemos a vernos en persona!

Si tu servidor web no soporta WebP, verás un mensaje de error cuando intentes subir una imagen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si tu audiencia incluye un número significativo de usuarios con un navegador que no soporta este formato (IE11 por ejemplo), evita usar imágenes WebP.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"planes-para-el-futuro\">Planes para el futuro</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Se está estudiando la opción de que WordPress realice la conversión del formato WebP en las imágenes subidas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>También se está estudiando incorporar otros formatos más modernos, como AVIF y JPEGXL, que mejorarán la compresión y reducirán aún más los recursos necesarios para las imágenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"preguntas-frecuentes\">Preguntas frecuentes</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"como-puedo-ajustar-la-calidad-de-compresion-de-las-imagenes-webp\">¿Cómo puedo ajustar la calidad de compresión de las imágenes WebP?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Los desarrolladores o los plugins pueden utilizar el filtro wp_editor_set_quality para ajustar la calidad:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\n// Use a quality setting of 75 for WebP images.\nfunction filter_webp_quality( $quality, $mime_type ) {\n  if ( \'image/webp\' === $mime_type ) {\n     return 75;\n  }\n  return $quality;\n}\nadd_filter( \'wp_editor_set_quality\', \'filter_webp_quality\', 10, 2 );\n\n\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"si-utilizo-wordpress-multisite-todos-mis-sitios-funcionaran-con-imagenes-webp\">Si utilizo WordPress multisite, ¿todos mis sitios funcionarán con imágenes WebP?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><br>No. De momento el multisitio o multisite almacena los tipos de archivo que los usuarios pueden subir cuando se crea un sitio. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Para asegurarte de que todos los sitios existentes en una red permiten archivos WebP, puede utilizar el filtro site_option en un mu-plugin de red para añadir webp a los tipos de archivo permitidos para todos los sitios de la red:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\n// Ensure all network sites include WebP support.\nadd_filter(\n  \'site_option_upload_filetypes\',\n  function ( $filetypes ) {\n    $filetypes = explode( \' \', $filetypes );\n    if ( !

As many of our readers know, I am always on the lookout for those WordPress extensions that remind me of the era when I first started using computers and exploring the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin seemed to fit the bill. It had &#8220;retro&#8221; in the title, so it had already piqued my interest without even installing it. It had been years since I used Winamp. The media player was first released in 1997 for Microsoft Windows and grew in popularity through the early 2000s. By the time I arrived on the scene, it had already built a massive user base. It was the best option available for creating music playlists at the time, and it was skinnable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Winamp was popular back when the world wide web felt more alive. I still look upon it as the golden era of user creation and the blossoming of fandom. Where else could you find a collection of Brad Pitt skins for your computer&#8217;s media player? Or, <em>One Piece</em>? Even <em>Super Mario</em>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did not hesitate to install this throwback plugin. Unfortunately, it errored out whenever I attempted to add an audio file. So, I set it aside with a note to look at it down the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few weeks later, I read WordPress lead developer Helen Hou-Sandí&#8217;s <a href=\"https://helen.blog/2021/12/its-so-hard-to-say-goodbye-to-yesterday/\">goodbye announcement to 10up</a>, the company she had been with for a decade. With the help of Mel Choyce, co-workers Jeff Paul, Darin Kotter, and Tung Du created the Retro Winamp Block in her honor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I checked back in on the plugin. There was an update, and the change log noted a fix for the error I had encountered. In minutes, I was able to once again experience the glory of one of the first media players I had used on my old Gateway laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Retro Winamp Block in the editor.\n\n\n\n<p>Retro Winamp Block has does not have many options. Actually, it only has one customization that users will be interested in: the player skin. They can enter any URL for it, and over 83,000 are available via the <a href=\"https://skins.webamp.org/\">Winamp Skin Museum</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Winamp Skin Museum.\n\n\n\n<p>The museum is hosted by <a href=\"https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp\">Webamp</a>, a project that implements an HTML5 and JavaScript of the old Winamp 2.9. 10up used it for its own Retro Winamp Block plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since installing the latest version 1.0.1 of the plugin, I have only hit one issue. The live preview in the editor is partially broken. The player floats in the same spot instead of scrolling with the page..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I had one wish for this plugin, it would be to see the addition of Milkdrop, the popular Winamp visualizer add-on.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Winamp with Milkdrop add-on.\n\n\n\n<p>Mostly, I simply enjoyed this jaunt down memory lane. I even went as far as installing the latest Winamp on my computer. The original player still has a thriving community if its forums are any indication. The UI is practically unusable on my laptop, so I dropped it after listening to an old Ashlee Simpson album.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I enjoyed the nostalgia of the old player, I want to see modern-day implementations of these types of features for WordPress. Instead of a throwback to Winamp, where is the skinnable audio block?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I put together a quick pattern to test out some ideas (<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/justintadlock/a38e129326dfdbeff4498999130aeee8\">code on Gist</a>):</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Cover + Audio + Social block pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/photo/63161c1f1d/\">background is by Jeff Golenski</a> from WordPress Photos (this directory is already coming in handy). A few adjustments later, I had a custom-styled audio layout. However, I could not modify the audio player itself. It is just the browser default. There is no equalizer, track info, or visual flair. Just a clean, boring player that longs for someone to sprinkle a little pizazz on it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 02:43:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"Post Status: Post Status Excerpt (No. 39) — WordPress 5.9: Delays, the Customizer, and Contributing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=91867\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://poststatus.com/excerpt/39/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59922:\"<h3>&#8220;Too many things were interrelated and we didn’t have enough people who were looking across…&#8221; —<strong>Anne McCarthy</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In this episode of Post Status Excerpt, David has an informative chat with <strong>Anne McCarthy</strong>.

So I decided to stay home and it hurt your</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> Twitter</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> game. Yeah. Twitter didn\'t ban me. So, you know, I must be on the good list. But yeah, it was, I thought it was you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you did you watch it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> I did watch it, but I will admit that I was helping with the slides that day. So what I did actually watch, I was pretty fried by the time I actually watched it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> How did you help with the slides?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> Just from afar. There were some demos that needed some voiceovers and designers had done two wonderful demos, but there was just no con like voiceover to explain what was actually happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I jumped in to do some of those and just kind of fill filling gaps with the</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I knew that voice sounded familiar.I mean, not every voice cause I\'m like, wow, you must have had a lot of cigarettes that day for that for that voice. But no I forget his name, but we, there was a voice that I remember for one of the [00:02:00] demos that previously did, like a whole bunch of WordPress demos and he has an accent and I can\'t think of his name right now, but I will later&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> Oh, you\'re probably thinking Michael Peck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yes, that\'s probably</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> yes, he did the 5.9 voiceover demo. And that\'s actually like, I don\'t know if you\'ve seen a YouTube video, but there\'s a awesome YouTube video. That group has worked on. A WordPress YouTube channel. And he did the voice over for that. And it\'s like a really cool kind of throwback to the early days where he would do release videos and he like knocked it out of the park.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> What does he do besides does all he do is voiceovers. What does he do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> No, he works for automatic. Now. He\'s mainly focused, I think on a combination of probably. Brand and design stuff or a purse.com. So</p>\n\n\n\n<p>we got them on loan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I said, he must have, you must have been in some virtual cafeteria, regular cafeteria back then in the here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you\'re like, oh, that voice, I must have that voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> It\'s very impressive. I have a friend who has a really good radio voice. I\'m always really [00:03:00] jealous. I want him to record my voicemail at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Oh yes. Anybody with an accident? I wanted to be good. I want it on mine. My parents said I always had a great face and voice for books.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let\'s talk about, let\'s actually talk a little bit, the videos. How did the I know you\'re involved in them now. I, you seem to be in the. We\'re going to have our IC a video. Most of the time, outside of the state of the word, it looks like you, that you are pushing them. Are you primarily the one that makes those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> Yeah, for the YouTube videos. I have some on my personal channel that I do, I did help with the 5.9 video, mainly from a logistics wrangling, like figuring out script actually did an initial voiceover that got nixed and be like, Michael police come in here. I was very sick and Michael very graciously hopped it at the last minute, but mainly I just kind of help out in terms of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming up with ideas. So sometimes with learn WordPress folks, I\'ll also share some like review what they\'re working on, but a lot of the YouTube videos on my channel are [00:04:00] just things that I find interesting or that I anticipate with the next release. We just need to get some content out there and I\'m fortunate to be so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the project that I can share things early and from there I can then send them to folks who actually have real followings and be like, Hey, I know you\'re probably going to create content, but the navigation block, here\'s like a rundown of all the features. Here\'s how I\'m presenting it, like do your thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it actually started that way where I was just creating content as a way to actually demonstrate something for other people to kind of just. Get the word out about something new that was coming and it was easier to communicate, especially from afar using videos. I had no aspiration. It helps a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And I have zero aspirations to be like a YouTuber. I just like, I don\'t think I\'m, you know, have the equipment or the ability to be very good at it. Like some folks are in the WordPress community, but it is fun. It\'s cool. I guess to have it\'s very visual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s very visual. I know a lot of people really appreciate the, like, just give me the heads up [00:05:00] in two to three minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause I remember when I think after Gutenberg was launched, we really appreciated those two or three minute demos that was at Marcus did during the state of the words or during presentations at work camp us or something like that, where you sat down in two minutes or three minutes when you got basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you needed to know. And it was, there was a wow factor there. They, you know, they look at time and space by doing this. I think that\'s a very good idea and I hope you continue. Yeah, I plan to, so</p>\n\n\n\n<p>yeah, I appreciate that because I\'ve got a lot of encouragement from Paul AC and Nathan Wrigley, and they were both like, you should do it, but you\'d be fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, I don\'t know, like, I don\'t think I have the time or I don\'t think it\'s like saying that I would be very good at. And I\'ve gotten good feedback where people are kind of like what you\'re saying was like, I need to see the visual and also. Who is so close to the project on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s like, give me the little details. Like, I don\'t want to just see it at a high level. Give me the like bells and [00:06:00] whistles. So it\'s kind of a, it\'s a cool, neat way to connect with folks too. I\'ve gotten this just this week. I had like three or four people reach out and my contact form, like, Hey, I watched your video about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, can you help me with facts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Oh great, I\'m a support person now! Yeah. Now. But it\'s, you know, in the beginning was so easy to see the mess because there were massive changes or adjustments happening to Gutenberg, but, and there still are, but now things are being tweaked and being refined. And over a post status, Courtney produces like every week she produced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is the list of things that are happening in core. And of course, a lot of it\'s Gutenberg related. Yeah. And, you know, share, feel free to share with me your thoughts on this is it. I think it\'s becoming a little bit harder now to gauge a lot, unless it\'s a big headline feature and full site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can get into that unless it\'s a headlined feature that you\'ve been hearing about. I think, you know, when I do the summaries and do the post for post status and what little time I have to review the text, which is in a [00:07:00] make.wordpress.org document. It\'s kind of hard to visualize a lot of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And therefore it\'s kind of hard for anyone outside of maybe two or three dozen people to really communicate and train, you know, translate that excitement to other people or to show how much progress is being made. Because you read a bullet list and it\'s, you don\'t know, you don\'t know how much work is happening behind those bullet lists for starters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, you know, something could do something very cool visually, but if it\'s just on a bullet list on make.wordpress.org, the public not gonna see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> Yeah, no, I think you\'re right about that. And that\'s one of the things I don\'t know if you\'ve noticed, but in the last year or so the designs and like the visuals that had come with the what\'s new in Gutenberg posts have definitely been upgraded because of that exact problem is it\'s like, show me the value, show me how it actually connects, how it makes my life easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there\'s also a series of posts. I do the core editor improvement posts. Yeah, that also seeks to even highlight that more. And it started out as like highlighting individual things. And recently I\'ve [00:08:00] actually had to switch to not have to, but it actually makes sense to switch to like a collection of improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have a post right now that I\'m working on with a couple of folks. On like performance at 5.9. So let\'s talk about the performance enhancements. Let\'s run through it in one place so you can see it. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> You\'ve given me a topic to talk to you about. Thank you. But to some somebody\'s credit though, and I think when they do the Gutenberg plugin, Release posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They do offer him graphics and they\'ve gotten better with videos. I just wish everything was an animated GIF so I could share it. That\'s a lot easier. Thank you very much. So those existed, but like, I think for what you\'re doing and for some of the things that I think flying under the radar, you know, that, you know, not again, not the headline features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the there\'s nothing. Then a short video. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> And the connecting the dots. Like I started that connecting the dots series, just kind of on a whim because I found something that I was like, you can do this. If you combine these different tools, you can then do this crazy thing. Like I think [00:09:00] that\'s also, I actually, that\'s the series I\'m probably most excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, it\'s fun to do these headline, like explore navigation blockers from 5.9 or the query look like that. Those are fun videos to do, but the connecting the dots. It feels more exciting. Like I\'m like, gosh, yes, get this major feature in your head. But then also like, let\'s talk about like the weird things you can do and the cool things you can do when you actually combine these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause that\'s, what\'s really powerful is it\'s not like cool. We added dimension controls to this thing, but like what does this actually allow me to do? Okay. This.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Practical application right? Yes. Cause those are the videos I\'d like to show off from the meetup groups. And a lot of times meet up organizers, just say, this is cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the media bargain meet up organizers. If they\'re good meetup organizers say, and this is how it could apply to you person, that\'s running an agency out of there out of a phone booth or whatever it is you do. Let\'s transition from weird to WordPress 5.9, because you could say something [00:10:00] happened a little bit weird on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yeah. It\'s supposed to be out or right around this time of rigidly, right? I think it was before the holidays. Yeah. You mean the same date as the state of the word? Really? Yeah. I didn\'t put those dots. Yeah. That, that, that would yeah, that\'s a coincidence. So it didn\'t happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you tell me a little bit about what happened and what was involved in making the decision? No spoilers, but to push that into charity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> Yeah, it\'s a really tough decision. And I\'ll preface this by saying I wrote a post that on why I voted to delay it. So I won\'t go into hyper detail cause there\'s a lot of detail on that post that I try to make it very practical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\'s how you can enact a lot of videos and like images being like, this is why. But yeah, this is my first time on a really squad too. So I don\'t have the historical knowledge that other folks bring to the table, but from my point of view and from my experience. Which program, which really is where I\'m coming from too many things were interrelated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we didn\'t [00:11:00] have enough people. Who were looking across basically is the long and short of it. So, you know, 2022 is relying on you know, certain things get in place with styles, but at the same time, those working on styles aren\'t necessarily solely focused on 2022. So like, it was kind of, there was a weird tension there of bringing a lot of unrelated things together,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> ultimately, I\'m sorry, was it like the sunny from Philadelphia meme where the chart is. I think it\'s Charlie, he\'s looking at the board behind him and then the oldest red strings going everywhere. And he\'s trying to explain something was a kind of like that a</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> little bit. Yeah. There is a little element of that, but almost imagine. That if you were to remove one of the strings, like that feature wouldn\'t make as much sense anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So remember how we were just talking about connecting the dots and how things working together is actually where the value like hyper value goes. That\'s what basically was going on, where it was like, if we ship these things independently, we could in theory, remove some of the stuff. But it\'s going to be, it\'s just the value kind of isn\'t as exponential when they\'re all together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was [00:12:00] looking at the issues. I test it every day, like, especially leading up to release for 5.8, 5.9. I\'ve been testing every single day in this stuff all the time. And a lot of it was refinements. It was like, there were a couple of things that, some big decisions. So one I can tell. There was stuff around the navigation block, how to reuse it across Wakim\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So originally there was a thing called navigation areas that was a new block that got reverted. That was I think, the right call. And then there the browsing. So when I talk about browsing, it\'s like, how do you navigate between your homepage, your templates and your template, parts and styles? Like what does that system look like from an information architecture perspective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there was a weird combination of. Technical constraints that came up as well as like design, so design and the technical constraints. We\'re kind of dancing with each other. And at a certain point, it just got to a place where. Fortunately like a middle ground could be found. And I think the solution they have right now is excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally that, that seemed to be not viable. So kind of by having the delay, we\'ve [00:13:00] had like a better solution, I think, than what was originally in place. That\'s been tested a lot with the outreach program, so it\'s a lot of it. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Am I correct in understanding you that you were the one who initially brought something up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> I was not necessarily, there was a team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah, everybody started getting the idea around the same time. Maybe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> Yeah, it was one of those where I think enough people kind of paused and like, I can tell you leading up to the release. I was like, okay, are we really feeling good about this? Like, I had some moments, but I also wasn\'t like confident and being the person to say like, we can\'t ship this, we can\'t ship this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I\'m definitely not one of those decision makers, but I mean, I\'m filing, I was filing tons of issues and getting, and with the outreach program, obviously, like I\'m seeing the complaints, I\'m writing a summary post. So like I knew what the pain points were. And then at a certain point, it becomes a decision for the designers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like what design direction do we want to go in? And that\'s kind of where we landed, where it was just like a last minute kind [00:14:00] of Too much to figure out. And a lot of it\'s like little things too. So I\'m talking about these big decisions. If there were a lot of small things that need to be sorted out that thankfully were more refinements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I felt really comfortable delaying and voting to delay because of that, because I was like, the value will be exponential. If we can ship these altogether, everything I\'m seeing right now can be figured out like at first. And I think this is where the confusion really started. There was this like long list and it was all seen as blockers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So originally there was like this get hub issue that Someone did there. I think it was Rob who\'s, the corridor tech lead, who has been doing an excellent job. All the lease lead folks have been doing amazing work and he wrote all the issues out and gathered all of them that people were flagging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they were seeing all his blockers and that wasn\'t the case. Really from that list, there were like a subset of blockers that were truly like, we need to delay this. And that\'s part of the chaos of, you know, working remotely. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> You had a translated into a sound. It would be mostly that. So yeah, I would imagine the [00:15:00] holidays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It didn\'t help that the fact that we have this, let\'s be honest, the last two weeks of the year or the last week of the year, the first week in the new year, however you want to slice it really for me, three weeks, really, or two and a half at best, but sometimes three weeks for everybody to get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if they\'re staying home, even if they\'re not traveling, it\'s your brain is kind of in a reset mode. Yeah. Like I need, listen, I may not be leaving my house, but I\'m taking a vacation, so you\'re not talking to me. Regardless if you celebrate any of the holidays or not, there\'s enough mass people taking time off visiting family, or just staying at home or away from computers that I would imagine productivity would\'ve hit a dive there and, or you didn\'t want to, nobody would want it have taken the chance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we don\'t want to make Matt Mullenweg into Scrooge because he\'s to he\'s the lead. Right. He\'s the lead. Right. So that would be, yeah, that I\'m correctly associating the[00:16:00] fictional character with the appropriate reference. Thank you. Case. I get an email later. So when is a WordPress 5.9 coming up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> It\'s going to be released January 25th. And as you were saying, like originally the beta was only pushed by two weeks, but then we had to add extra time because of the end of the year period and beginning of the year. I mean, it\'s just a chaotic time. And I think that is also the right call. I don\'t think it\'ll hyper disrupt any other releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there\'s a ton of stuff for 6.02. It\'s not like, oh, by delaying, we\'re going to have a really light 6.0 release. I think it\'s gonna be. How\'s that going to change as</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> well? Is that going to be a little bit compressed then in the first part of the year, you think, or is different people working on different things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> Yeah, I think at a certain point it might compress it a bit, meaning like there might be a release in like March or something like that, but they actually didn\'t release the schedule for 6.0 yet. So I\'m not really sure how that\'s going to impact. Things I will say part of the discussion that\'s come up amongst score contributors when I\'ve checked in with a lot of them, when this was going on to make sure everyone was doing okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a lot of them were like, man, this is when I wish [00:17:00] we had more releases. Like I wish we could have this like more of a release cadence where it\'s more frequent. So we\'re not like needing to do with delay. Cause like the options were not fun, but that\'s the constraints of the current system. And, you know, ideally in a future world, it isn\'t as Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each release. You can kind of say like, it\'s okay. We can ship this because we have another release coming in a month rather than like three months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah. Is that possible though? I mean, is that possible at least where we stand right now, because we just talked about how. And like how integrated are, how one piece is related to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, you know, maybe this is just one of those junctures in the four stages of Gutenberg or whatever timeline you want to pick where yes, it all is intersecting together. Cause it\'s full site editing. I mean, it\'s the words are in there. It\'s full side. Right. And then maybe down the road with when he gets to collaboration and translation, maybe things will go a bit easier, but regardless it\'s like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know there\'s so many, there\'s so many ways you can look at it. I hear about a lot of time in other technology groups, in terms of first, you have people say, well, why [00:18:00] don\'t you just release every month? It\'s no worries. Any automatic updates. It\'s fine. And then that happens. And then you say, why are we getting so many updates?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have to keep updating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Which, which, you know, is another subject in of itself because in theory, You shouldn\'t have update fatigue, if you have automatic updates turned on and you know, that\'s another thing too. You know, in some situations that\'s not possible. So you\'re going to have people, whether it\'s a real problem or something that someone projects into their mind, like some sort of ghost but it\'s still a legitimate thing to deal with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I see. So yeah, you have this, you it\'s a bunch of. All not the code, but the responsibilities and the dependencies is a bunch of, you know, a bunch of well cooked, fine high quality spaghetti.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> And yeah, it would be really tricky to do. Like, I don\'t necessarily think that\'s like a viable thing right now, or I don\'t, I can\'t speak to it in the future, but I do [00:19:00] think it is a result of, you know, the circumstances that we\'re in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we\'re all impacted by the same constraints. And I think that\'s one of the things where. You know, for example, there are, I don\'t think it was fully scoped out even like, what would a dependency plan look like where it\'s like, or contingency plan? Sorry, look like where if let\'s say we had to remove some of these things, would we, excuse for example, we could do things like remove browsing entirely, which is one of the things that was, I think, shipped at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re instead you have, you know, your appearance menu, you have templates, simpler parts, the editor styles. And so you have no sort of browsing in the sidebar. You could also like say, you know what, the navigation block isn\'t ready or counting it to another release. You could also say like, you know what, you can\'t actually create new templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can only just view the ones that come with your theme. Like there\'s a lot of ways that could have been pulled back. But thankfully what shipping is very comprehensive. Like I think that\'s the good thing with this delays also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I don\'t think anybody\'s looking at it going on, man.[00:20:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> Yeah. And I mean, I also think the good news is ultimately these features that we\'re talking about, which get a lot of attention are going to impact a small subset of people. Like this is not going to be five point where all of a sudden it takes over your site and you have to use it like this is it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s very much. So in line with the gradual adoption, where if you want to use these features, you have to literally hyper opt-in. You have to switch your theme. You have to like seek it out. Like it\'s very much something that. That also gave me confidence where it\'s like, I know these like full siting and all the collection features that go along with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get a lot of attention. But even if you upgrade, you\'re not switching to full site editing, you\'re still gonna get a ton of value in this release. And that, that to me is what\'s really exciting is it\'s almost like, because this is a smaller subset. The features are more high impact exponentially when they\'re working together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it was just the right call, but I\'m really excited to see people get their hands on 5.9. And speaking of police health tests, the Tesco lead, I\'m like, please help test. It\'d be a huge help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> We\'ll get through testing in a second, because I [00:21:00] do want to, I do want to get, like, if you had the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make it to make a pitch for you. You did mention 5.0 though. When that first came out, I think there was a there\'s a number of people that, and you know, that the circumstances behind that you know, around the state of the word time, everybody was busy or give Ghana was one of those. I think it wasn\'t November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I mean, it was approaching a holiday season or something or something like that, but it was, I would be, I don\'t know, a lot of people said it was around rough around the edges. I\'m not going to argue with him about that when it came out but over time that the improvements on it have been, I think in my opinion, pretty good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty, pretty tremendous. In fact, do you think and you may, I think you touched on this already, but do you think with a full site editing, we\'re going to see not what 5.0 is. Cause I think you just said that, but do you feel comfortable with the level of Polish that will be out at the end of January?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that\'s a great question. There\'s a lot of nuance here, so it depends [00:22:00] upon someone\'s skill level. If you were brand new WordPress user, I would, I\'d say very beta. So like, I think it\'s literally going to ship with a beta warning. So in terms of, is it hyper polished? I would call it functional kind of empowering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I wouldn\'t necessarily be like, oh, it\'s delightful. And you can, it\'s completely intuitive. Like I think, and I say this partially because especially if someone, maybe if someone was new, they might actually have an easier time, because there\'s a lot of concepts built within full that are really hard to grasp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of us who\'ve been in WordPress for a long time. Things</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Can they get those videos in there? That would probably help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> Yeah, no, I think that\'s part of, so I actually am also helping with the user support docs for this release. So I\'m co testing it and then helping with the user docs. And that\'s one of the things that\'s really difficult to communicate simply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So like, how do you explain to someone, what template parts are. And how do you explain when to use them? So, like one of the, I just opened an issue for this yesterday, but it\'s like, we probably need to explain the difference [00:23:00] between template parts, reusable, blocks and patterns. And when do you use each? So I probably need to write a doc on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there\'s a lot to be explained there in a way that\'s very simple so that people can make good decisions. And right now their, what is being shifted doesn\'t necessarily have guardrails to nudge someone in the right direction. If that makes sense. So you\'d have to have some level of knowledge in order to write.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put it together, but do I think it\'s a polished V1 for someone who likes to tinker? Definitely. Like, I, for sure think that\'s the case. The only I can tell you my major sticking point, which is driving me nuts right now is right now. Are you familiar with the template editing mode?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ve played with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Yeah. So right now let\'s say I have a block theme activated and I\'m using 5.98. I can go in and I\'m using a theme with template mode. I can go in and I can like add a new post. And then under the posts kind of sidebar, I can select and create any template. And from there I can have a fresh new template that I can then assign to the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if I\'m in [00:24:00] the site editor and I\'m navigating through the templates, I cannot create a new generic template. And there\'s an issue open for this. I can create an archive when I complete a search warrant. I create a new front page one, but there\'s not a. I want to create a new template and I want to sign this poster page or this category to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there\'s a lot like that basic infrastructure you can, it\'s a workflow thing. So it\'s like in one place, you can do this thing, but in the other place that feels more intuitive. You can\'t. And then on top of that, obviously for this release, some stuff is constrained. So this was one of the decisions that had to be made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can\'t have. If you wanted a category to use a specific template, you\'d have to actually add it to your blocking files rather than like being able to do it in the interface. So the good news is it\'ll ship, but then there\'s some really common. Possibly common use cases where people are going to be like, oh, but I want to do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s where I think 6.0 6.1, like these future releases will continue to deliver on the promise to pull siding. And I think right now what is in place is really powerful. And I think it\'ll [00:25:00] actually jumpstart. People\'s excitement into everything that you can do. But there are just some. I don\'t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think Justin Tadlock had a good description where he\'s like, it works, but then as you\'re getting involved in it, there\'s like some common things that you\'re not yet able to do. And I\'m like, yeah, that\'s very true. Like there are some things that I can imagine. I\'m like, I would love on my personal site to have a specific template for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All my posts that are tagged with WordPress resources so that I could just send people there and I could have a different header. I could have a different contact form, like have a completely different experience with that. I think it\'d be really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> But you know, I was like, it sounds like something in the old days before Gutenberg, that would be like a WordPress plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You would have to find</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Which in the defense of Gutenberg, in terms of that, I mean, You know, you\'re, it seems like a lot of the, you know, a lot of the major work being done, but also some things that are being done in Gutenberg. Like duotone, for example, maybe it\'s the one that jumps out at me. It\'s like, [00:26:00] like before it was just, you had to go find a plugin for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, you\'re you and birds taking off. Lots of cool and interesting things that were before with maybe with, or with maybe with a page builder, with an add on with a page builder or just a plugin that those were just like little thrills that you would just find in the plugin stuff, getting Berg\'s incorporating this in the course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Gutenberg, I mean, it\'s not just a, it\'s not just the blocks anymore. You\'re incorporating all these like, you know, fun stuff that like, maybe. Not even the majority of people might even use some time, unless there\'s a big, duotone a fan group out there. In other words,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> the only thing that I think is cool is that you can add it on theme level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that\'s part of it. It is very much a design tool in that sense. And I think that. To me where I\'ve seen it really come to life is when I\'ve seen some theme authors. I think some automatic female author is released. It\'s skate park is a theme, but it has like do a twin filters baked in. So like, if you change the [00:27:00] background of your theme, the images were also like a doc, the duo tone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Oh no. My F my life is a French film to atone anyway. So I\'m full of that. Did you happen to hear. I think when it comes to block themes, Matt said something about wanting 3000 a year or so. Was he exaggerating there a little bit? I</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> think he\'s serious. And like, I also, this sounds wild, but I think it is very much so, like he actually thought it was interesting that he said it in that way, because how do I explain this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, You could take one block theme, like let\'s take 20, 22. For example, the announcement post showed this and any announcement posts, it shows like four or five different style theme Jason files and switching between them. And it looks like a completely different theme. And I think that\'s where it\'s like, you could literally take the base of one theme with the same patterns, all that sort of stuff, and create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>20 different theme, Jason files to switch [00:28:00] between and have a complete different experience. And to me, that\'s, what\'s really cool. And then once you start integrating with the pattern directory even more, I think that unlocks some really cool stuff. So when he says that, I\'m like, yeah, I understand what he\'s saying, but I actually, I think that\'s a way to connect with like the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FIM world that we have come to know to last however many years. Yeah. But I think the future with block themes, things are going to be wildly different. I think rich table were asked a question about, you know, could there be a directory for different style? And I\'m like, yes, like that to me, I think is a really cool model and there\'s work being done to enable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And json switching within a block theme,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> so definitely would make it competitive with you know, like, like a Wix or Squarespace in terms of like you could have, this is a completely customizable experience. Speaking of customizable, I do have a question for you. When it comes to the full site editing, what happens to the customizer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s numerous people that use that there\'s people that use that and granted they use that for their theme settings and maybe. And [00:29:00] for other things, and in addition to the normal customization, so what\'s going to happen to the customizer?.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> Yeah. So this is actually something that I\'m so glad you\'re asking me this, because this is a thing I\'ve seen, brought up a ton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ve gotten, especially in the span of like, it felt like two weeks, I was getting a ping, like every other day being like customizer. And I\'m like,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I know like a bot on Twitter about the customizer, but I\'ve figured that ask you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> So basically the customizer, if a plugin or theme happens to look into it the customizer will be available to actually it\'ll direct you to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\'s not like it\'s going away forever. Is it removed from the menu item? Yes. If you\'re using a block theme, you will not see it unless you are using a plugin that somehow hooks into the</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> customizer, but you have to switch to a block theme and then at the official</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> blocking the lose, the customizer only superior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Correct. And it would only disappear if you don\'t have a plugin that happens to look into</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> it as well. Right. I\'m sure somebody will come up with that in a few seconds, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Then I, you know, initially [00:30:00] here, I mean, I\'ve, haven\'t had my coffee yet, but it sounds like to me, that makes sense where in terms of, you know, you\'re not going to need it. You may not need it. Now, if anybody has anything in there, there\'s probably something developers that have put something in there that shouldn\'t be in there then, you know, get out, get it out of there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But okay. That answers that question pretty well, because it makes sense. With a block theme on there shouldn\'t be anything in the customizer left.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> There is a universal theme. I don\'t know if you\'ve heard about universal themes, but they\'re also a combination. So there\'s like, let\'s see there\'s black beans hybrid themes, universal themes, and classic themes is like theme paradigm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re about to enter and blockings are like fully built in with full siting. Like you\'re not, you know, using the customized or anything</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> like that. You don\'t need the, you don\'t need the additional CSS. The one thing that sticks out in my mind is the additional CSS thing in the in the customizer and you and I both know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That if I don\'t usually use that, I use, I, I add the CSS some other way. It\'s usually through a plugin or through the style sheet, in the theme [00:31:00] or something like that, whatever. That\'s the only thing that kind of concerns me a little bit, because I\'ve seen people put CSS in there that relate even to plugin, not even the theme directly, because that\'s just one place that they\'re able to put CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They know it they\'ve seen it, or some webpage told them to put it there, that they don\'t have to like dig into any code to, they can just put the additional CSS. In fact, it wouldn\'t surprise me if some WordPress plugin support people have told people, oh, in order to resolve this issue with our. You just need a CSS tweak with your theme going here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But again, you\'re saying that it\'s still going to be there unless they switched to a block theme. So the only danger there is if you switch to a block theme, but if you\'re somehow using the plugin, is that, does that, it\'s just hiding it. It\'s not removing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> It\'s just hiding it. It\'s not removing it. So</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had to work that out. Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> no I totally understand. Cause I used to work on Jetpack a lot and that was one of the things. It has an additional CSS part of it. So I understand what you\'re describing. [00:32:00] Yeah, it\'s very, I also want to advocate actually for universal themes, because if someone is like, I\'m curious about this world, but I don\'t want to jump in universal themes are basically designed so that you can use blocking functionality, but then also the customizer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it basically bridges. Which is why it\'s called universal</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> either that or the movie company bought you the rights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> Did you not hear about the new acquisition?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I was going to go to the theme park in Orlando and see all the new Gutenberg blocks, right? The ride, the Gutenberg ride. Oh my God.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> You say that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I did. I was getting beer the other day at a store and there was a thing called gluten berg. Which is a form of gluten-free beer. And I was like, oh my God. And I was off work. So I was like, am I tripping right now? Like, what is happening, dude, bird everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I made a slip on Twitter, I think yesterday morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I said something about like, I\'m having a state of the word hangover, a hashtag Gutenberg. And I left it in there and I just said, Gutenberg is just you [00:33:00] trying to contribute to the project, but you haven\'t figured out yet how to be sustainable. So you\'re, and you\'re not above begging. So, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So I left Gutenberg and I left good Megan, there let\'s talk about at least two more things before I leave you to. Fantastic video editing work here. One thing is about testing. What is the number one way? What\'s the number one? What\'s number one thing you advocate regarding testing. And you\'re going to give me symbol links to put in the show notes for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we\'re not going to worry about that, but how does that work and what do what\'s the qualifications and what are you looking. In terms of testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> It\'s a great, so like the beta posts on, I\'m going to drag people to the beta posts on your research backslash news, because there\'s actually a link under like a testing instructions to a post that I did that gets very detailed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you just are comfortable testing, go for it. If you\'re someone who needs more instruction or. Exactly. Like what to test, how to test. I have a post that\'s it\'s titled help test 5.9 features, and it [00:34:00] goes step by step through the different features with like a brief description of what they are, how to find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as well as like, if you want to get even more detailed steps, a lot of them link out to calls for testing that were done through the outreach program. So you can even get like a step-by-step description of what needs to be done. But yeah, right now, if you can, I highly recommend testing both 5.9 in terms of, without a block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then also take the 2022 thing first, then it is a very cool expansive team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Hey, Matt gave us the bird on Tuesday and my wife looked at me like I was, should report it to the. Yeah, but it\'s in, that\'s also another, that\'s another complication layer too. It\'s not just the five nine release. It\'s it\'s the new default WordPress theme. It looks fantastic. It is the, it looks fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m more excited. I can\'t remember the last time I\'ve been more excited about like a default theme coming up because it really looks like it\'s using the art state of the edge [00:35:00] stuff, plus, you know, the birds well, good. Well, thanks for you. Share those links with me. I\'ll make sure to add them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I make them in there. So here\'s one thing that\'s been. I was scratching my noggin the other day and trying to figure out the best way to describe this. So I\'ve been told by multiple sources that thanks to COVID thanks to the lack of in-person work camps. The contributions contributors have been, they\'ve been low for the past 16, 18 months, two years, something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then. Do you think that first of all, do you think that\'s true? And if so of it\'s true. Do you think it\'s, is it impacted the project because Matt, I guess I\'m just gonna finish my sentence and let you speak at the end, because I don\'t know when to shut up, but I did see, I saw Matt slides on Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He did highlight. I mean, there are lots of circles in the slides, right. And then there was lots of new contributors. Yes. Circles. I work in [00:36:00] shapes. But there were, and there were lots of new contributors to that. We don\'t know what they worked on. I mean, new contributors, that\'s awesome in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there was definitely a lot of circles on there, but do you think that COVID has had an impact on the contributions or contributors over the past two years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> I mean, yes, both. And I will say, I think it\'s like a. Multi-directional so I think it\'s everything from, for example, the outreach program, I\'ve given out 70 badges for a test contribution, which is probably more than has been given in a long time, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\'s like, in some ways we\'ve had more contributors, probably in some spaces and have brought in. And I\'ve had the chance to work with folks who have gone out into their local communities or held things online with their local communities to help people test and explore that. So there\'s like, it\'s both right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I think in some cases it really burns some people out. I think it burned a lot of folks out were just dealing with like trying to survive day to day. You\'re probably not going to want to jump into open source and contribute. [00:37:00] But at the same time, I think suddenly the community had to become a lot more accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So actually I started this role in April of 2020, so right when things were really like in the U S it was. Getting really serious, like in lockdown, all this sort of stuff. So it\'s been very interesting. I, when I first started the job was told like, oh yeah, one of the first things we\'d probably do is send you around a bunch of word camps and word cancer, where people get onboarded and like all this sort of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, okay, well that\'s not an option. So what are we going to do about this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> And this is where we\'re all kind of delusional about like, oh, maybe this will pass. And so it\'s been very interesting and like, I can tell you speaking personally, a very anecdotally I have spoken at probably 10 or 11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Events, maybe more in the last year I do not like public speaking. If I had to go up on stage and do it, it would be way less successful for me. Like it causes way too much anxiety. And then on top of that, like, you know, I just gave the word camp Taiwan recorded or camp Taiwan keynote at [00:38:00] like one 30 in the morning of my time where like, normally I would have to travel to Taiwan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would have to, you know, be jet lagged pregnant. There were a couple of days early, like all this sort of stuff. And then it. Being able to connect with brand new contributors and brand new folks has become way easier. And so I think that\'s like one of the things that makes me really excited is like, you can travel the world from your apartment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I often look@theonlineeventson.org and just see what people were talking about. And we\'ll just jump in. Either a 5% or 50% meetup</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> group. Oh, I love her. I love virtual stuff. I talked to my kids. That\'s how I talked to my kids all the time. My kids still live with me, a side note. So do you, so,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> yes, I do think it\'s also caused a decrease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there\'s an over-reliance on On people who are sponsored contributors. And I think, but I think it also, at the same time, new pathways have been built. So I\'m both encouraged that like new pathways are being built. New folks are being brought in and things like the photo directory, the pattern directory even blockchains are way easier to build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:00] I think we\'re going to see an influx of more folks coming in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The onboarding process. Right? I would imagine. Yeah, like you said, it\'s harder for any individuals with present condition. So I, you know, companies like, like, and Matt was showing those, the other bubble slide where there was automatic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I imagine there\'s like you said, you were doing one thing now you\'re doing another, it sounds like there\'s automatic made some adjustments there to. I\'m not putting words in your mouth, but if it wouldn\'t surprise me, if some companies made some adjustments to compensate for the fact that, you know, there is less of certain kinds of contributors out there just because of oral conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we just finished. I don\'t know if you\'ve been following this log for. She fought with J or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> Log4jI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Mean, everybody\'s talking about it. I mean, nobody\'s rewriting my software yet. Thank goodness. I\'m unpopular now. And it\'s an advantage but I mean, there, you have, like, I think two people, one [00:40:00] person working on that and the guy had a side job too, and now everybody\'s kind of relying on it and you know, that makes you sit back and watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, a lot of people rely on WordPress. Obviously things are going to slip through the cracks, but overall it\'s nice to have, even if there was a major world event and this has been a major world event, then I think things from a feature standpoint, from a bug standing standpoint, it could, I guess it depends on your experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can either say it\'s been fantastic that it\'s managed to be as uninterrupted as it has been over the last two years. Or you can just say, Hey, it could have been worse. It, you know, WordPress runs 43% and the train has to keep moving. The show must go on. And some adjustments, I guess, have to be made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m looking, I do want to see more independent or at least other companies enter into that bubble space. Just like Matt had. I mean, at one point it was a bubble\'s commercial, but I mean, you know, that second slide with just more independent bubbles on it. So it sounds it\'s, but it sounds like for [00:41:00] me talking with you here, that of all the challenges that\'s happened, both ones that I think everybody could imagine in some of the ones that you\'re not telling me, because we don\'t want to get into the weeds on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds like, from stability-wise I th the decision. To bump it. I think it was only a little bit controversial for a moment. At least from the outside. I can\'t speak within the inside of a group. I imagine there was a lot of talk and maybe there was some tradition or precedent there, but obviously that would have didn\'t sound like that lasted very long if there was any, and it was only controversial out here, like, you know, weirdo land where I live, you know, there was news, but it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, fine. You\'re bumping it from December. I think I\'d rather have that been bumped. And so it sounds like,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> And that was part of why I wrote the post to be honest, because I was like, man, this is going to be so confusing and people who aren\'t just like knee deep in this, like it\'s going to be seen in a light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s like really hard to parse. And so that was really part of my aim and writing [00:42:00] like, Hey, this is why I voted. And this is the details. If you really want to know Of course, Matt, I don\'t know if you saw Matt\'s comment where it\'s like, this is the actually information I want. Like that\'s a different post that Matt. Like, I can\'t, I don\'t want to write it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Let me do my work. Cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> I know I got that comment on Sunday and I was like, oh, okay, cool. Like I, where do I need to write out a post about this? I was like no. We have to do a retro for the release. Like, this is a really good, but he\'s right. I was like, oh man, I should have included some stuff about like, here\'s what I think we can do going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it was chaotic. I wrote it, I think, within a week of the decision. And it was doing it on top of other stuff. So</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> yeah, next time it\'s a long story, but next time I have to get you to get him to say banana milkshake and the state of the word I have. If you don\'t know what it is, I\'ll try to put a link in the show notes, but anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. But th the thing about the bingo card is we put some obvious ones there, and then we put some less obvious ones. Like there\'s like, like NFT. He said NFT. Okay. How about metaverse? You said metaverse.. Okay. Now it\'s like, everybody\'s doing bingo. Bingo, and going, oh, crap. I could have made [00:43:00] this harder, except everybody has a one random generated word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s like I was saying to myself, what\'s the antifree square. It\'s what\'s on a bingo card. What\'s one thing he would never say. And then everybody says, well, we can\'t get bingo. And he says banana milkshake. And I\'m like, all right, people put on your big person pants. And we\'re going to see if we can get someone there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway, besides that way, we\'ll edit this all out. It\'s boring. but anyway, and what you do, but. To end on a good to end on a very good note here, because I\'m talking to you and you do very good things. So this is going to be very, it\'d be very you\'re very much appreciated in. And even if the resources, even if the testing, you know, is, you know, we could always use more testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can always use more contributors. I think the job that you\'re doing, the videos is doing two things really well, everything that you do, it\'s not just the videos, but the videos, just making things a lot easier to consume. Especially in this Tik TOK world we live in don\'t do tick. I didn\'t say the tick-tock</p>\n\n\n\n<p>world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> I mean,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> here, my kids don\'t either [00:44:00] I\'m that I\'m not going there, but two it\'s also about the transparency for something like this, I think because it wasn\'t such of a talking point, partly was because you and the team were so transparent. And the minute that we read, the minute I read the report, I\'m like, yeah, this sounds like the way you\'re presenting it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A it\'s a, no, it sounds like a no-brainer and B we can wait another month. I can wait another month.,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> I really credit folks like Tonja and Mary and Rob. And like, there\'s a lot of folks who made that transparency. This is tough decisions, Jonathan to Rogers. Who\'s not even on release squad was like giving advice about timing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like it really was a team effort to operate in that way. And I loved seeing the liveliness of the 5.9 release leads channel, and it folks are curious about how our release works. And you can literally watch us talk. And there is no back channel. Like it\'s like, I have a question I\'m going to that channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah. I need that. I need kind of that for my, from my marriage. Cause it\'d be nice to have some texts. You didn\'t say that will [00:45:00] let me do a little search here. And where are you going to your mother\'s? Okay. I\'ll catch you later. All right. So, and tell us where we can find you on the web and where people can reach out to you, especially if they have questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> I\'m at an Zazu and an E Z a Z U on we\'re personal work slack. And then I have a block like I\'m very I know shocking nomad dot block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Make sure to throw that into the show notes or give that to me and I\'ll put in the show. Yeah. Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> I will. And like, I honestly am not, you can find me on LinkedIn, but I\'m off of Instagram. I activate and deactivate quite frequently. It\'s the one that I seem to be, I do too, but that\'s in</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> real life, but yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know you\'re not on Twitter and you\'re sometimes on Instagram. That\'s why I wanted to get a few links for you because I\'m in post out a slack and there\'s posts at a slack there\'s WordPress slack. Thank you very much for sitting down and talk to me about this. I think</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> thanks for the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s so much, I feel like we could talk about, which is always such a great feeling is it\'s like, gosh, I could just talk for hours about these different things, because I think so much about them and you [00:46:00] really hit everything that I want to talk about. So it\'s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah. Why didn\'t I have this skill when I was young and single, I have no idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That gives me food for thought later, but anyway, I really appreciate it. And I will I\'ll definitely be checking out the betas for 5.9. We can\'t wait for January.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy:</strong> Awesome.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 23:18:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Olivia Bisset\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"Akismet: How to Stop Contact Form Spam on WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=2177\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://blog.akismet.com/2021/12/29/how-to-stop-contact-form-spam-on-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15509:\"<p>Are you getting useless contact form emails in your inbox? Contact form spam is a problem every website owner deals with at some point. Spambots target websites of all sizes, regardless of the amount of traffic you get.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sifting through hundreds of messages to separate spam from genuine inquiries is time-consuming and frustrating. Luckily, there are some easy and effective ways to protect your WordPress site from spam and take advantage of the benefits of contact forms. Let’s discuss!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-2177\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-contact-form-spam\">What is contact form spam?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before solving this common issue, you’ll need to understand what contact form spam is and how it affects your website and business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contact form spam is exactly what it sounds like:&nbsp;unwanted messages that are submitted through the contact forms on your site. Since these forms have blank fields, an individual spammer (or bot) can fill these out however they’d like.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might just get one or two occasional messages with irrelevant promotional material or even offensive language and links. Or, you’ll sometimes receive hundreds or even thousands of form submissions to your inbox. You’re left sifting through the spam so that you don’t miss real messages from interested followers or potential customers. Worse yet, all of these submissions can hog server resources,&nbsp;resulting in a slower site or errors when you try to make changes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spammers target contact forms in one of two ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-manual-spammers\">1. Manual spammers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Manual spammers are humans who navigate to your website, fill out your forms, and submit them personally. They typically use false information, often copying and pasting to spam your site quickly. In most cases, these spammers are trying to promote specific websites. But they can also spread malware and funnel traffic to malicious sites. Manual contact form spam is more difficult to overcome because spammers can get past many anti-spam solutions like CAPTCHAs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-spambots\">2. Spambots</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Spambots are the most common sender of form spam and often the most dangerous. These programs automatically search the internet for forms and, depending on how spammers program the bots, they leave junk text and phishing links that appear in your inbox.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spambots threaten the integrity of your website when programmed to perform more malicious activities like taking personal information, spreading malware, or taking control of your website. These automated programs can leave a larger number of form submissions at once. But they’re easier to stop because they can’t combat specific anti-spam solutions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"why-do-bots-and-human-spammers-target-contact-forms\">Why do bots and human spammers target contact forms?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With all the advances in technology and increased security options, it’s hard to think that this type of spam still exists. But bots and human spammers still target contact forms because they can, and it works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are several reasons spammers look for loopholes and vulnerabilities in your website forms:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>They want to send you spam.</strong> Most spam includes links to phishing sites or revenue-generating ad sites.</li><li><strong>They want to exploit your contact form to spam others</strong>. Spammers use your contact forms to relay email spam messages to others. When these emails land in people’s inboxes, they typically look like an email you sent. Unaware that it is spam, users open these emails and click links that lead them to another website. This increases website traffic and engagement to that site, rewarding the spammer.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>They’re searching for vulnerabilities to access the backend of your website or server</strong>. This is typically where malicious intent comes into play. When spammers target your contact forms to look for vulnerabilities in your website, they often want to attack it. Spammers can install malware that leaves your website and visitors at risk. They can also steal personal information, a significant risk for eCommerce sites with sensitive customer data.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-identify-contact-form-submission-spam\">How to identify contact form submission spam</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping a close eye on your contact form submissions makes it easy to identify spam. Watch out for the following signs that indicate spammers are targeting your website:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Phishing links</strong>. Spammers use phishing URLs to obtain sensitive information for malicious use. This includes usernames, passwords, or banking details. Phishing links appear to direct to a legitimate site, but it’s really a fake one meant to steal this valuable data.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Irrelevant messages</strong>. Another typical indication of spam is unsolicited or irrelevant messages. Spammers send these messages out in large numbers for advertising, phishing, or spreading malware.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Submissions with no real name</strong>. If you get submissions with no real name or a fake name, you’ll want to look into blocking form spam.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Grammatical errors or typos</strong>. Most spammers don’t take the time to proofread their submissions or check for grammatical errors. Instead, they work hard to send as much spam as possible in the shortest amount of time. Therefore, if you notice messages or comments with a significant amount of typos or grammatical errors, your website is likely under attack.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>An offer that’s too good to be true</strong>. Like everything in life, an offer too good to be true also indicates a problem. Don’t fall for this easy trap.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you notice a spam issue, it’s vital to find a fast and effective solution. While it’s both annoying and potentially dangerous, spam can also damage your brand reputation. Let’s explore some ways to prevent contact form spam on your website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-block-contact-form-spam\">How to block contact form spam</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-install-the-right-wordpress-anti-spam-plugin\">1. Install the right WordPress anti-spam plugin</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest and fastest way to combat contact form spam is to install the right <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">anti-spam WordPress plugin</a>. Anti-spam plugins work independently from your forms by comparing submissions to blocklists of words, names, IP addresses, and email addresses. They use both global and local learning to identify spam. Some also give you the ability to manually mark items as spam (or not spam), so it learns what you like and don’t like on your site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With several options available, it’s critical to pick the right anti-spam plugin. <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a> is an excellent option used by millions of websites to filter out hundreds of millions of spam comments and form submissions. It will check all comments and form submissions for spam and filter out any that look suspicious. You can review all filtered submissions directly in the WordPress dashboard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An option like this frees up your time to focus on the more critical parts of your website. It also gives you the peace of mind that your site, visitors, and reputation are safe. While there aren’t many disadvantages to this method, you’ll need to make sure you update the plugin as recommended to avoid any security issues in the future.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"how-to-set-up-an-anti-spam-plugin\">How to set up an anti-spam plugin:</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Installing a WordPress plugin is easy. In your WordPress dashboard, go to <strong>Plugins → Add New</strong>. Search for the one you’d like to add, then click <strong>Install → Activate</strong>. Then, follow any specific instructions for the tool that you chose. For example, Akismet provides a great <a href=\"https://docs.akismet.com/getting-started/activate/\">how to activate</a> tutorial with easy-to-follow instructions and visual cues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-add-a-custom-captcha\">2. Add a custom CAPTCHA</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.akismet.com/2021/12/23/do-captcha-and-recaptcha-protect-wordpress-sites-from-bots/\">Custom CAPTCHAs</a> are another way to target and resolve spam problems. You can add a custom, word-based code or random math question to your website that visitors must answer to submit forms successfully. When users attempt to add a comment or submit a form, they’ll need to answer the question or type what they see above the submit button to proceed. You can add several custom word-based questions that users cycle through randomly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While CAPTCHAs are a great way to combat spambots, they aren’t effective with human spammers. They can also be frustrating and time-consuming for legitimate site visitors who struggle to answer the questions or answer them incorrectly. If you choose to add a CAPTCHA to combat spam, you’ll also need to think about users with limited sight or other challenges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"how-to-implement-a-captcha\">How to implement a CAPTCHA:</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To add a CAPTCHA to your website, you’ll need to choose a service provider. Google is the most popular CAPTCHA service, with essential functions offered at no cost to website owners. You can find your options in the <strong>Products</strong> part of the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://developers.google.com/products#r\" target=\"_blank\">Google Developers</a> page. Make sure to sign in to your Google account. Next, you’ll read through a short overview before clicking on <strong>Sign up for an API key pair</strong>. You’ll need to fill in your website information and follow the prompts to complete the process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-use-google-recaptcha\">3. Use Google reCAPTCHA</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Google’s reCAPTCHA is a more advanced option than custom CAPTCHAs. Initially introduced to overcome the user frustrations of custom CAPTCHAs, reCAPTCHAs require users to answer more straightforward questions to submit forms. reCAPTCHAs also work by detecting user behavior while visitors navigate your site and assigning each user a “spam score” based on what the tool considers suspicious activity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common form of reCAPTCHAs is the picture puzzle you’ve seen on many websites. Instead of typing a word or answering a math question, users answer an image-based question. Visitors must select all the squares in the picture with a specific object like a car or a traffic light. Once all images have been selected, the button switches to allow the user to submit their form response.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some other types of reCAPTCHAs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Checkbox reCAPTCHA v2 </strong>is a simple box that users must check to submit a form. It’s the popular option you see on many websites accompanied by the “I am not a robot” text.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Invisible reCAPTCHA v2</strong> does not display any visible fields to human users. Instead, it monitors user behavior for suspicious activity to identify potential spammers. Invisible reCAPTCHA also adds an extra field into the code of your form. Since most spambots use code to submit responses, these spammers automatically fill in the fake fields before being flagged. Human users never even notice the spam control as they submit answers directly on the form.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>reCAPTCHA v3</strong> is an advanced option that uses JavaScript to detect human visitors. It is the most advanced form of reCAPTCHA, so you should only use it if you’re a WordPress expert.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHAs can still prevent genuine visitors from submitting forms, but they’ve improved from the earlier custom CAPTCHA options. Most come with the ability to add an audio option for those with visual impairments. The visible option they offer is also a solution for the hearing impaired.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Photo © Google\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"how-to-implement-google-recaptchas\">How to implement Google reCAPTCHAs:</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll add reCAPTCHAs to your website following the same steps listed above for CAPTCHAs. Google reCAPTCHA is also a free service for basic functionality, but you can purchase the Enterprise solution for more advanced options. You’ll need to sign up for an API key pair for your site and follow the prompts to proceed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-use-an-ip-access-list\">4. Use an IP access list</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you notice a lot of spambot action on your website coming from specific sources, you can use an IP access list to block spam. With this method, you add IP addresses to a list that restricts access to your website from that location. You’ll do this by adding IPs to the <strong>Comment Blacklist</strong> section of the <strong>Discussion</strong> settings page in the WordPress admin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using an IP access list is an excellent option for blocking specific people. But it takes a lot of work to block a more significant number of spammers and requires constant maintenance. You can also accidentally block legitimate form submissions from the IP addresses you list, so make sure you’re confident before using this method.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"how-to-implement-an-ip-access-list\">How to implement an IP access list:&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to block an IP address, navigate to <strong>Settings → Discussion → Comment Moderation</strong> in your WordPress dashboard. Then, simply add any IP addresses you want to block and save your settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"5-take-advantage-of-the-honeypot-method\">5. Take advantage of the honeypot method</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re not a fan of CAPTCHAs, try the honeypot method. Honeypots are little bits of code used to catch spambots. The code creates a hidden field in your form that’s invisible to human visitors but visible to spambots who are usually looking at the code of your form. Spambots automatically fill out the hidden field and submit the forms. The additional information flags these submissions and rejects them, saving you time and effort.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One advantage of honeypots is that they stay hidden from human visitors. Your visitors don’t need to deal with the inconvenience of CAPTCHAs. Some WordPress form plugins even allow you to add the honeypot method in their settings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"how-to-implement-honeypot\">How to implement honeypot:</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Some plugins allow you to quickly check the option to add honeypot to your forms. But if they don’t, you’ll need to add a hidden field to your form manually. Once you add the form to your site, use the CSS style “display: none !important;” to make the field hidden and tabindex=&#8221;-1&#8243; autocomplete=&#8221;false;&#8221; to ensure the field is empty by default.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"protect-your-wordpress-contact-forms\">Protect your WordPress contact forms</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Contact forms are a great tool to connect with your audience and enhance your website’s user experience. But they can also be a problem when spammers attack. Don’t be the target of human spammers and spambots that reduce the effectiveness of your website forms. Use the six steps listed above to successfully stop spam from your WordPress site so you can focus your time and effort on more essential tasks.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 12:28:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Simon Keating\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"WordCamp Central: The first in-person WordCamp Europe in 3 years is coming!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/?p=3143787\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2021/12/28/the-first-in-person-wordcamp-europe-in-3-years-is-coming/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1047:\"<p>WordCamp Europe organizing team has shared what we are planning for <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2022/a-sneak-peek-at-wceu2022/\">the first in-person WCEU in 3 years</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s taking place in Porto, Portugal, on 2-4 June 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all safety measures, our beautiful spacious venue,&nbsp;Super Bock Arena can hold up to 4000 people, and we can&#8217;t wait to welcome you there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2022/call-for-sponsors/\" target=\"_blank\">Call For Sponsors</a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2022/call-for-speakers/\" target=\"_blank\">Call For Speakers</a> are already open!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2022/a-sneak-peek-at-wceu2022/#newsletter-form\">Subscribe to WordCamp Europe Newsletter</a> to get to know about all WordCamp Europe 2022 updates first!</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2022/files/2021/12/WCEU-assortment-pic.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 28 Dec 2021 12:52:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Sabrina Zeidan\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"Matt: Saving the Internet\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=55240\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"https://ma.tt/2021/12/saving-the-internet/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1935:\"<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pierce\">David Pierce</a> wrote a deep profile, over 4,000 words, for Protocol and asks the question in the headline, <a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/matt-mullenweg\">Can Matt Mullenweg save the internet?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/matt-mullenweg\"><img /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings to mind <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines\">Betteridge&#8217;s law of headlines</a> (née Hinchliffe&#8217;s rule), &#8220;Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word&nbsp;<em>no</em>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&#8217;t save the internet.

Studies were already showing reduced effectiveness of existing vaccines against the variant. On December 13, New York governor Kathy Hochul <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/omicron-coronavirus-variant-12-13-21/index.html\">announced a new temporary indoor mask mandate</a> for public spaces, which could be bypassed by requiring vaccines for entrance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked how the State of the Word&#8217;s coordinators decided on the precautions, WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy said the event met the local guidelines while allowing attendees to make their own choices for anything beyond the requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We followed the guidelines as laid out by the city,&#8221; Haden Chomphosy said. &#8220;Masks and hand sanitizer were liberally available throughout the venue, and we encouraged attendees to make informed decisions about their health.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html\">well-documented</a> that indoor masking can significantly reduce transmission, so it was curious that the event did not require them at this pivotal time when governments are taking more stringent measures to stop the spread of the virus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately all those who were recently infected have reported mild illnesses, but the incident raises an important question for onlookers: Is this an indicator of how in-person WordCamps are going to go in 2022? There are already several on the <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">schedule</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Agreed. It has definitely killed any thought I had of attending a WordCamp for a good long while.</p>&mdash; Chris Wiegman (@ChrisWiegman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisWiegman/status/1474167091372642312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 23, 2021</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether or not attendees&#8217; infections originated at the State of the Word or in outside gatherings is going to be impossible to pinpoint, but the nominal safety protocols sends a message to all those considering attending in-person events in 2022. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since receiving the notification of possible exposure, many State of the Word attendees have been monitoring their health with tests. One attendee reported in Post Status Slack that she has had difficulty getting tested and is still waiting for one in the mail. In the meantime, she has opted out of a family gathering for Christmas as a safeguard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As someone who wants nothing more than to be able to attend WordCamp Europe or WordCamp US in person next year this doesn’t give me much confidence,&#8221; Gravity Forms CEO and co-founder Carl Hancock said. &#8220;With such a small event the COVID protocols could and should have been super tight to test things out for larger events. The lack of masks and social distancing at an indoor event without added protocols such as rapid testing for entry was disappointing to see.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp organizers will need to consider how they can protect attendees beyond simply meeting the basic, local requirements, which may not fully acknowledge the nature of the current threat. They will also need to be responsive to the rapidly changing pandemic landscape and be ready to implement more safety protocols at the last minute, if necessary. If the State of the Word is any indication, future WordCamp organizers will need to have a plan for sending exposure notifications to attendees, in case the events become the source of an outbreak.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 24 Dec 2021 04:38:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 10.0.0-beta2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=322588\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"https://buddypress.org/2021/12/buddypress-10-0-0-beta2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3714:\"<p>Hello BuddyPress community!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f3b6.png\" alt=\"🎶\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />  <em>All BuddyPress wants for Christmas</em><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f9d1-200d-1f384.png\" alt=\"🧑‍🎄\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> <em>is you</em> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f3b5.png\" alt=\"🎵\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> &#8230; to <strong>test this new pre-release</strong>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven’t tested our first&nbsp;<a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2021/12/buddypress-10-0-0-beta1/\">10.0.0 beta release</a>, here’s another opportunity to help us put the final touches on our next major release so that we make sure it will fit perfectly into your WordPress-/ BuddyPress-specific configuration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beta testing is very important, and we need you all, whether you’re a novice or an advanced user, a theme designer or a plugin author. <strong>Please contribute</strong> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-61cd8dc511fa2 wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button aligncenter\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-white-color has-text-color has-background\" href=\"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/buddypress.10.0.0-beta2.zip\">Try BuddyPress 10.0.0-beta2</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-has-changed-in-10-0-0-beta2\">What has changed in 10.0.0-beta2?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Custom Group Extensions: if you activated one or more plugins adding a new tab to your groups or if you built one or more plugins playing with the <a href=\"https://codex.buddypress.org/developer/group-extension-api/\">Group Extension API</a>.

There are a few important changes to note in this release regarding how the WordPress admin will direct users who are exploring block themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to a fix in beta 4, it was possible for users to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/54549\">switch to a block theme within the Customizer</a>. This has been changed so that users will see a banner notifying them that the block theme is incompatible, if they try to switch within the Customizer. Here&#8217;s the commit message:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Starting in 5.9, block themes are not compatible with (do not support) Customizer; rather, they use the Site Editor. Viewing installed themes in Customizer, this commit adds an overlay message to alert users and give them a way to activate the block theme. Clicking on the &#8220;Activate&#8221; button activates the block theme and redirects back to the Appearance &gt; Themes interface, where the user can then enter the Site Editor for customization.</p><p>Non-block themes are not affected by this change and continue to work in Customizer.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Having themes work only in the site editor or the Customizer, depending on which they support, is likely to be a confusing workflow for users when testing themes. This incompatibility message and redirection is necessary but not ideal for the long term. Streamlining the customization workflow will depend on how quickly the WordPress community is able to produce and adopt block themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some testers also reported that the Site Editor doesn&#8217;t allow users to edit or preview non-active block themes. The preview only works with active themes. This isn&#8217;t necessarily a bug but rather a feature that needs to be discussed for the future. A <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/37201\">ticket</a> is open in the Gutenberg repository, recommending the implementation of a Live Preview for non-active block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured patterns from the pattern directory should be displayed under Patterns in the the block inserter, but for some reason this wasn&#8217;t included in 5.9. It has been <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/54623\">backported in beta 4</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This beta also adds a filter that allows developers to disable the login screen language switcher, which is a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-to-introduce-language-switcher-on-login-screen\">new feature coming in 5.9</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release team has determined that a fifth beta will not be necessary, as of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/12/22/dev-chat-summary-december-22-2021/\">yesterday&#8217;s core dev chat</a>.

In an email sent out to all customers, Gardner said his team had issued refunds to all current customers. The business model is changing, and Frost will be a freely-available project going forward and focus on full site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frost is a WordPress theme that Gardner released earlier this year as the main product of a new startup business. The original version was shipped as a child theme of Genesis, the StudioPress theme framework he had spent much of his WordPress career working on. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-acquires-studiopress\">WP Engine acquired StudioPress</a> in 2018, and Gardner <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/brian-gardner-steps-down-from-studiopress\">stepped down from his role</a> in October 2019. It did not take him long to find his way back into the WordPress theme development game, bringing his personal style back to the theming world with Frost. Then, he landed a new job within WP Engine&#8217;s ranks in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am leading the WordPress Developer Relations team at WP Engine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have a simple mission: Accelerate innovation in WordPress and help the community transition to the block editor and Full Site Editing (né Gutenberg). In addition, we want to cultivate an interactive and immersive community resource that serves as a treasure chest of knowledge and operates as a conduit between the WordPress project and its users.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked if there was something concrete he could share, maybe what form that would take, but he did not go into any other details. In general, the more resources the development and design community have around the block system, the faster the ecosystem can evolve. Only time will tell what Gardner&#8217;s team within WP Engine creates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When I joined WP Engine in late September, it was evident to me [WP Engine] saw the value in building relationships with designers, developers, and creators &#8212; within our <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/atlas/\">Atlas</a> product line, as well as with WordPress,&#8221; said Gardner. &#8220;While there was interest in Frost when I came on board, it wasn&#8217;t until my vision for our team became clear did an acquisition enter the picture. I recommended bringing Frost into the company and hiring Nick Diego.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diego is the creator of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/from-ecommerce-integration-to-location-based-controls-block-visibility-pro-expands-upon-its-free-version\">Block Visibility</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/add-custom-svgs-via-the-icon-block-wordpress-plugin\">Icon Block</a> plugins. He also began working on Frost in late September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In alignment with WP Engine&#8217;s core value of &#8216;Committed to Give Back,&#8217; Frost is transitioning from a paid product to a free one,&#8221; said Gardner. &#8220;Given the change in business model, we issued full refunds to all active customers. By open-sourcing Frost and focusing on Full Site Editing, we hope to encourage a community of builders to experiment with the expanding capabilities of the block editor. We believe in its potential and look forward to helping it grow.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frost is open to everyone <a href=\"https://github.com/wpengine/themes/tree/trunk/frost\">via the WP Engine themes repository</a> on GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"leaping-into-block-theming\">Leaping into Block Theming</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">When Gardner sold StudioPress in 2018, several factors played a part in the decision. Among them were the uncertainty around the Gutenberg project and WordPress&#8217;s future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It took some time for me to put the pieces together, but when I did, I saw just how powerful the block editor has become,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In particular, I am excited about block patterns, global styles, and building themes that folks can use to create beautiful websites with little effort.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result of his newfound enthusiasm around the block system was Frost. I have had the opportunity to tinker around with the theme. It has Gardner&#8217;s signature minimalist design style, a focus on readable typography, and ample breathing room for the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simpler designs almost feel par for the course with any block theme these days, regardless of the theme author. What is likely to set Frost apart is its <a href=\"https://frostwp.com/patterns/\">block patterns</a>. It currently ships with 38 of them. The layouts should allow users to quickly set up their sites, along with the theme&#8217;s custom block styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am a huge fan of block patterns and see their potential when paired with the growing support of design/style elements within <code>theme.json</code>,&#8221; said Gardner of the things he is excited about. &#8220;Additionally, the site editor is something I feel, once mature, will be a game-changer for WordPress and those who build for it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-pattern-explorer/\">Block Pattern Explorer</a> plugin was initially a part of the Frost library plugin, but Gardner and Diego pulled it out and make it available to everyone. They also wanted to serve the Frost patterns through it. The hope is that the enhancements already in place via the plugin find their way into core WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Frost theme patterns via Block Patterns Explorer\n\n\n\n<p>The design is a bit more polished than core. It includes category types, a feature the theme uses to separate its own pattern categories from others. The experimental explorer plugin allows users to preview patterns via desktop, tablet, and mobile views. And, it has a clear &#8220;Add Pattern&#8221; button for inserting a block pattern into the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, they plan to sunset the plugin once its features make their way into WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress theming has come a long way since Gardner first dove in over a decade ago. Back then, users had to open template files to customize bits and pieces of their homepage. As we move toward WordPress 5.9, users will have that same power. However, they will modify Frost via the WordPress site editor instead of PHP files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Yes, I feel we are circling back to some degree,&#8221; he said.

The irony here is that we see WordPress used in sophisticated ways that &#8212; to be honest &#8212; I never thought would be possible. As for me, I believe in the power of simplicity.

You may have done so many of these little quizzes that you groan just seeing one on a form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are quite a few different versions, but they all can help protect your WordPress website from spambots and make your life simpler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, we’ll cover the evolution of CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA. We’ll also go over the different versions and the pros and cons of each one. Then, we’ll show you how to enable reCAPTCHA on WordPress and explore additional security measures you should implement.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-2164\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-are-captcha-and-recaptcha\">What are CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA serve the same purpose: protecting your website against bots and other security threats. They’re typically found on contact, comment, login, and password reset forms. But there are some key differences between the two safety checks. Let’s take a look at each one in detail.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-captcha\">What is CAPTCHA?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The acronym <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/1217728?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CAPTCHA stands for</a> Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart. It’s a mouthful, but the name says it all —&nbsp;it can decipher the difference between a human and a computer operator. Still, the specifics are important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/CAPTCHA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">early 2000s</a>, when it was created, CAPTCHA used a distorted text (letters and numbers) test to prevent bots from compromising websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When faced with a CAPTCHA, users needed to decipher broken text correctly to prove that they were, in fact, human. If they couldn’t identify the letters and numbers, the test wouldn’t submit their requests.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was revolutionary because most humans could pass it easily, but computers couldn’t solve it themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-recaptcha\">What is reCAPTCHA?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA follows a similar principle, but instead of just utilizing meaningless text to see if the user is a real human, it was designed to help computers digitize old books and newspapers. The test was essentially split into two parts shown side-by-side —&nbsp;one traditional CAPTCHA to determine the humanity of the user, and a second image of letters from a piece of text the computer was trying to digitize. If the human could pass the first part, it would accept the user&#8217;s input for the second part as an accurate translation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img /><em>Photo from <a href=\"http://www.captcha.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">http://www.captcha.net/</a></em>\n\n\n\n<p>The point is that reCAPTCHA added a second part to the test to put millions of human users to work —&nbsp;a few seconds at a time —&nbsp;to digitize historical text for ongoing record keeping. Now sites were protected from bots and users weren’t totally wasting their time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/luis-von-ahn-creator-of-duolingo-recaptcha-2014-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">purchased the technology in 2009</a> and improved upon it over the years. You see, artificial intelligence (AI) eventually became sophisticated enough to read and decipher even the most challenging text with <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2014/12/are-you-robot-introducing-no-captcha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">99.8 percent accuracy</a>. By doing so, they could pass the test and trick it into thinking bots were humans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To deal with this new issue, reCAPTCHA made things even more challenging, introducing new options like the famous “I’m not a robot” check box.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Today, reCAPTCHA is a widely-used security measure that protects websites from various spambots and cybercriminals by helping to ensure that comments on blog posts or in forums, and submissions on forms come from real people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-different-versions-of-recaptcha\">What are the different versions of reCAPTCHA?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are technically four different types of active <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/versions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reCAPTCHAs</a>. Instead of text, some tests may use images, audio, or even math equations. They also utilize some variation of&nbsp; “<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2014/12/are-you-robot-introducing-no-captcha#:~:text=reCAPTCHA%20protects%20the%20websites%20you%20love%20from%20spam%20and%20abuse.&text=We\'re%20calling%20it%20the,having%20to%20solve%20a%20CAPTCHA.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA</a>”, which determines whether a user is suspicious simply based on their behavior on a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re setting up <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/features/security/\">WordPress website security</a>, you may have the option to choose between different reCAPTCHA types. For example, you can select a checkbox or background verification:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the different types of reCAPTCHA:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>ReCAPTCHA v2 (“I’m not a robot” checkbox):</strong> This is the simplest and easiest test to add with limited coding knowledge. Sometimes it passes or approves users right away and prompts them to check a box. Other times, it asks them to verify that they’re human with a puzzle challenge.</li><li><strong>ReCAPTCHA v2 (Invisible reCAPTCHA badge):</strong> For this version, there’s usually no checkbox. It simply uses an existing button on your site or a JavaScript API call for verification. You’ll see a badge that says <em>Protected by reCAPTCHA</em>. Essentially, verification happens in the background. Only the strangest behavior will prompt a test.</li><li><strong>ReCAPTCHA v2 (Android):</strong> This version utilizes a reCAPTCHA Android library that’s part of Google Play’s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet\" target=\"_blank\">SafetyNet APIs</a>. This validates requests from within an Android app, so it’s not the right choice to use for a WordPress site.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>ReCAPTCHA v3:</strong> This is the most advanced and discreet of all the versions. Visitors won’t even know it’s happening. It uses a JavaScript API and automatically assigns a score to each user to approve or deny them. This version also gives more advanced developers extended flexibility for integrations with other security measures to dictate the level of site security.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>ReCAPTCHA Enterprise:</strong> Like v3, this runs in the background. It gives each site visitor a score based on their behavior. If a visitor is deemed suspicious, it may require them to verify their identity through custom options determined by each site —&nbsp;two-factor authentication or email verification. As its name implies, this is typically for enterprise-level sites and requires advanced customization.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-should-i-consider-when-choosing-a-recaptcha-version\">What should I consider when choosing a reCAPTCHA version?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since reCAPTCHA Enterprise is reserved for larger companies, it’s safe to say that most websites will need either reCAPTCHA v2 or reCAPTCHA v3. Still, it’s important to know what you’re getting into with each one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-recaptcha-v2\">What are the pros and cons of reCAPTCHA v2?&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most significant advantage of reCAPTCHA v2 is that, whether you choose to include the “I’m not a robot” checkbox or leave it discreetly running in the background, it protects you from spam while offering humans the opportunity to prove that they’re real.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the invisible version, if it detects suspicious behavior, it will require a test. If it doesn’t, the user can proceed none the wiser.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, any reCAPTCHA v2 test can seriously hurt the user experience for site visitors. To combat increasingly smart AI technology, tests have become so tricky that many real humans have trouble passing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The test’s difficulty may leave users frustrated, wondering why they fail when they are actual humans. In fact, the situation has become so bad that popular tech magazines <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/im-not-a-robot-why-captchas-hard-to-solve\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">give people tips</a> on passing these tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, it’s also important to consider <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the accessibility of reCAPTCHAs</a>. A graphical puzzle, for example, would be inaccessible for people who have vision impairments. So, if you do decide to use reCAPTCHA v2, it’s important to present other options, like audio or text-based tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-recaptcha-v3\">What are the pros and cons of reCAPTCHA v3?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA v3 was specifically designed to improve the user experience. With no verification tests to complete, it’s seamless. Website visitors are happily unaware of the entire process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also gives administrators much more control. With reCAPTCHA v3, you have advanced options to customize your interaction with Google’s API to adjust scoring thresholds and define what is considered suspicious behavior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some may consider this added control a good thing, while others may find it a weighty and cumbersome responsibility. Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90369697/googles-new-recaptcha-has-a-dark-side\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">some critics believe</a> that reCAPTCHA v3 may pose a privacy risk because it provides Google with too much data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, reCAPTCHA v3 can deter good bots from doing important work. People tend to remember the villains like spambots, but forget about their positive counterparts. Good bots deal with things like SEO and performance monitoring. If you get in their way, your overall website success could suffer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A final downside is that, since spam scoring happens in the background, there’s no alternative test provided to suspicious users (like with the invisible reCAPTCHA v2 badge). Visitors who are wrongly flagged as bots don’t have an opportunity to prove their legitimacy. This means that you could turn away real customers, clients, and followers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"can-bots-bypass-recaptcha\">Can bots bypass reCAPTCHA?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the big question. Unfortunately, the answer may not be straightforward or definitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The many versions of reCAPTCHA are evidence that malicious spambots evolve quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re constantly adapting to outsmart reCAPTCHA. When the original CAPTCHA was introduced, it was revolutionary in its ability to decipher between real users and bots. But it didn’t take long before the bots caught on. People have even started <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2020/09/19/you-didnt-know-bots-solve-captchas-and-do-pharming-with-humans/?sh=706e34951a4d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">using human labor</a> to get past tests manually.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Computer scientists are regularly working to increase the effectiveness of reCAPTCHA, however. Some have <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18205610/google-captcha-ai-robot-human-difficult-artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">proposed new challenges</a>, like puzzles that require a user to maneuver pieces or nursery rhyme completion games based on the location of site visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s one major reason tests have become so frustrating for real users —&nbsp;difficulty has had to increase to stay ahead of computer learning. Unfortunately, it seems we’re at a point where to continue to outsmart computers, we have to make tests that are sometimes too difficult for real users to solve&nbsp;— a major problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s gotten so bad that <a href=\"https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&S1=9767263.PN.&OS=PN/9767263&RS=PN/9767263\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon now owns a patent</a> for a new kind of CAPTCHA-esque test that is so difficult to solve that only a computer can do it. Meaning… if you pass, you’ve actually failed because you’ve proven that you can’t possibly be human.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"so-can-recaptcha-stop-bots\">So can reCAPTCHA stop bots?&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it can stop many of them. But it can’t stop them all. And the percentage of bots that make it through is increasing by the day. This means you can’t simply rely on reCAPTCHA to prevent spam submissions. You’d be signing up for a highly imperfect, temporary system that’s only going to get less effective.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what <em>should</em> you do?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"other-security-measures-to-protect-your-website-from-spambots\">Other security measures to protect your website from spambots</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-lock-down-your-comment-forms\">1. Lock down your comment forms</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The best place to start is by configuring your WordPress comments in a way that protects your site against bots. Navigate to <strong>Settings → Discussion</strong> in your site dashboard and and consider requiring:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Comment authors to submit a name and email</li><li>Users to be registered and logged in to comment</li><li>Comments to be manually approved before publication</li><li>Authors to have a previously approved comment to submit a new one</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <strong>Comment Moderation</strong> box, you can also flag a comment that contains a certain number of links —&nbsp;lots of links is a common indication of spam. Or, if you’re getting a lot of spam that contains certain words, email addresses, IP addresses, and other characteristics, you can ban them entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-protect-your-login-forms\">2. Protect your login forms</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To lock down your login forms without using a CAPTCHA, you can implement <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/features/security/secure-authentication/\">two-factor authentication</a>. This requires a user to have both login details <em>and </em>a physical device to access your site. When someone logs in, they’ll have to enter a username and password as well as a one-time code that’s sent to the mobile device on file. This is virtually impossible for bots to get past.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-use-honeypot\">3. Use honeypot</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Honeypots are an option for protecting contact forms. Think of them as a mouse trap for bots. They essentially create a hidden field in your forms that isn’t visible to site visitors but that can be seen by spambots. If the field is filled out, the bot is stopped in its tracks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many contact form plugins allow you to implement this feature in their default settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-protect-your-comment-and-contact-forms-with-akismet\">4. Protect your comment and contact forms with Akismet</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet is hands-down the best way to eliminate the headaches of bots (or even real humans) spamming your comments or sending unwanted messages through forms on your site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With millions of users, Akismet has blocked over 500,000,000,000 spam submissions at the time of writing this article. With each one, it learns a bit more. So while bots might have AI to get past reCAPTCHAs, Akismet’s AI is working to protect your site in an entirely different way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet can accurately identify spammy behavior and keeps a blocklist of words, IP addresses, names, and emails to prevent pests. Plus, it gives you control to provide feedback about any spam it misses or real comments that it accidentally flagged. Then, it customizes its spam-fighting solution just for your site. Amazing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>You can get a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\">free version of Akismet</a> for your personal blog. In addition, there are three <a href=\"https://akismet.com/plans/\">paid plans</a> for commercial sites starting at just $10 per month.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"win-the-fight-against-spam-bots\">Win the fight against spam bots</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spam bots and less-than-ethical cyber actors are always trying to take advantage of visitors and the sites they love (like yours!). They can cause annoyance or even do real-world damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA have evolved many times over the years and continue to be one trusted way to prevent bots from flooding sites. But these solutions aren’t perfect, and sites need other measures to prevent spam from causing trouble. Consider protecting login forms with two-factor authentication, deploying WordPress best-practices, and using <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a> to filter comment and contact form submissions automatically.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 10:25:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Simon Keating\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"Post Status: Post Status Excerpt (No. 38) — In Person For State of the Word\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=91657\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://poststatus.com/excerpt/38/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38726:\"<h2>&#8220;I believe our community can make significant contributions to Gutenberg and the Block Editor.&#8221; —Cory Miller</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In this episode of Post Status Excerpt, Cory shares his experience among the 30+ individuals who attended the State of the Word in New York in person.

So.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Signature though is still in the lodge waiting. And I remember when Twitter kind of first came out and it was a thing to live tweet a lot. And but I always like yours because you always summarize what.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The takeaway is like you\'re starring the cool quotes along the way. And that\'s part of what we\'re trying to do at post status is give you the too long, didn\'t read content, the inside analysis commentary for the stuff that matters to you. So that\'s your claim to fame or friend?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that\'s how I took notes and I really didn\'t care who listened. I that\'s how I just took [00:01:00] notes. It kind of knocked off a couple of killed a couple birds with one stone, but enough about me. Let\'s. Let\'s talk about you being there in person. And can you tell me where this place w what was this place like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Was it in like a tall building or like, I hear it was tumblers all the offices or something.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So my understanding was it\'s the automatics new event space in New York city. And of course, some of their investors in New York city and things like that. And it was incredible space. I would try to guess how big of a space it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I couldn\'t tell, the camera angles were just, they did the camera angles just right. So you never got a true dimension of the room on the live stream</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;yeah, that\'s&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> what I just said. I do more tell me I bet you it\'s about 15,000 to 20,000 square feet in there that I saw really great space. And it\'s a whole floor of a billion is my understanding, but it was gorgeous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there\'s the sunset of New York city out the window rep for state of the word. And it was really good, but I. I, you know, I got to see [00:02:00] Matt about a month ago and San Francisco, we got to talk and he mentioned inviting you David, to stay the word. And also he\'d love to have Post Status there. So I was like, yes, we\'re going to make that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know you had things that come up, you couldn\'t be there. But you know, I want to guess there\'s about 25 30 people there in person. And it was a really nice night. I mean, automatic. Rolled out the carpet for all of us, which is super nice. Matt as always is a charming, elegant presenter and host and did a fantastic job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought it was normal. You know, I want to give him kudos, but like, he\'s really good on stage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Well he was different this time and I realized I wasn\'t in the room, but I almost had, I have a 30 inch monitor. So I saw a lot of him and I saw a lot of his facial expressions pretty clearly. There was there was something different about them in a good way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can\'t, I think he, you know, not just not to put emotions on a person, I\'m pretty sure he was nervous in some regard. I think anybody is nervous to some extent of public speaking, but he definitely had some sort of [00:03:00] energy that he was releasing. And you know, me, I record animated gifs all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided not to post, I don\'t know what I decided to post, but in the very beginning before he was kind of. He was almost dancing a jig right before way before the state of the word started up on stage. So he was really excited and really, you know, anxious maybe, but you could just see the energy even before he spoke anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could just see the pent up energy that he had, which was reflected later, by the way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> And not trying to speak for him, but if for me, I go, I haven\'t done this in two years. There\'s some cool people here that I have invited to be here and I\'m talking about the thing that I want to spend all of my life doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so. Yeah, totally. I spoke a couple of weeks ago at our three recurring revenue retreat. And I remember getting feeling nervous cause I\'m like I was rusty, you know? And there was this quote and I\'m trying to remember what it was, but it\'s basically turning fear, the anxiety into [00:04:00] energy and excitement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s what I tried to do is like channel that\'s now Matt doesn\'t need my public speaking tips, but those are my thoughts. What I. As long as I\'ve known him. And it goes back to 2008, where camp DFW in Frisco, Texas. There\'s one thing that\'s always standard with Matt and that is his passion for the WordPress open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, you know, and it just has never wavered. And I think he mentioned on state of the word that he wants to spend the rest of his life. He\'s 38 rest of this. On WordPress project. And I totally believe this. This is his contribution to humidity, you know, and at Post Status makers of the open web WordPress, this 42% of this big number that he shared out there, I think we should all take a moment, take a big deep breath and go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The web is still in its infancy. I don\'t know, life-stage wise where it would be comparatively to like a human, but it\'s still early, like in history of all that\'s going to happen in this world. In the future, the web is [00:05:00] still kind of an infant. And if you think about it, our place is WordPress makers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People that build on WordPress, extend WordPress, teach WordPress, all that stuff people have. Post-test the business to WordPress is this is historic and what we\'ve been doing. I started with WordPress, my first blog in 2006. That was just me using this amazing platform called WordPress, but, you know, history historically sake and going through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>42%, that number, it just keeps getting bigger. And that\'s exciting for us, those of us that make our living with on for WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah, he did. I got a couple of quotes out of them and it was, you know, livestream is a little bit easier. Cause you can pause and rewind a little bit just to make sure, because you want to get it as close as possible. Regarding the The WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He did say the court word press belongs. Just, you know, just to anybody it\'s not just you or me it\'s regardless of economic or political situations. And he said something about WordPress can\'t be [00:06:00] created by just one company and people adding a line of code is like giving that, give a penny, take a penny and I feel like there\'s quite a number of people that thanks to five for the future that are giving that he was, he actually said he actually gave a quote or something about, I don\'t know if you caught it. He was studying other CMSs. And he said for every dollar that has made $20 has made in the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s ratio is how they came up with the five for the future. Did you know that. I did not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> You know, I don\'t know how long, far, because the future has been out, but there\'s two things I wanted to highlight. Part of State of the Word you\'ve just put a square in this one, which is contributing back to core five for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t know how long that\'s been going, but, you know, I know our Post Status members. I mentioned this to Matt. They, you know, like me and I themes, we had, let\'s say at her height, I want to say 27, 28 people or something like that. And you go, okay, how do we, excuse me, our team or company contribute to core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don\'t have the profit bandwidth, all that stuff to take a full-time dev for instance&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> right</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> [00:07:00] off. And I mentioned this because I know there\'s so many giving hearts in WordPress and founders and entrepreneurs and people that lead companies. That benefit from WordPress that want to do five for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s tough. I get it from your standpoint of how do we meaningfully contributed, even though we believe we are contributing to the ecosystem or what we\'re doing. And I grant that a hundred percent, what we want to do at Post Status though I did tag on the contributions that push to continue to contribute to core.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that\'s the reflective I dunno, KPI for the ecosystem too, by the way. But, and I know there\'s companies that do it, even if it doesn\'t fall under the strict banner of farm from feature or whatever it is that like, they\'re doing it just like, we felt like we were contributing to WordPress for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I want to do is translate that help that better for our Post Status crowd to, to actually meaningfully contribute. So Courtney Robertson on our team, who is also great, awesome person at Go Daddy pro is really [00:08:00] taking the banner for the contributor days for post status. So next year, we\'re going to be talking about enrolling out contributor days, but that\'s one thing to say, we\'re going to do a contributor day, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s nothing new. This is where Courtney\'s idea was. Let\'s go to the team leads and ask for their wishlist. Things they would love for people of post status to contribute. And from that gives us something that we can go. Let\'s say we take that day eight hours. And we\'re going to show up for contributor today. at Post Status, were gonna, make it a contribute and then pick something off the board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we\'re already trying to help you do a little thinking in the stuff that\'s going to be most valuable to the core team, core teams that are doing things, and then say pick one off the list and try to get as far as you can. You know, and I\'m excited about that. I know it\'s very meaningfully and for good reason to Matt, both as CEO of automatic, but also the leader of the WordPress open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was one thing that for sure came out, you know, to me in that call.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah. There, [00:09:00] there was quite a bit talk about, there was talk about the contributors earlier in the live stream. And then afterwards it was how to get new and especially young people involved and you know, young people, they have so many distractions these days, but they have more time and they more energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we do cause we were running, families were running businesses and so forth like that. And I liked the question that Allie posed about. How can these people learn WordPress? But contributing I, you know, I, I lost my thought there for a second, but I really wanted to. I was hoping that the five for the future was going to spark some more ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think it will, because if you have people that are, if companies are being sponsored or sponsoring people to work on contributing and there should be. Like an on-ramp in there somewhere for people who want to get into it too, because you know, like many people have pointed out. You have to, unless you\'re a young person within, [00:10:00] with an inordinate amount of time, you don\'t have the time to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even for a couple of hours, and I think part of five for the future, and some people have brought this, you know, written about it after state of the word. And about that five for the future, maybe someday five for the future can be expanded a bit to help some people not only contribute, but also kind of help them find people are willing to cover them so they can contribute whether that\'s financially or some other means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe it\'s just some sort of internship if somebody is brand new and needs to be exposed to anything in WordPress. So I think five for the future is a great thing now, and I think it has got room to grow, but you know, it needs that it needs. Momentum of support right now and whether that\'s the repost status and all these other methods, I think we\'re still seeing the early stages of a comprehensive program for contributing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> And I understand the apprehensions from companies and founders and leaders. You know, you have to make a [00:11:00] profit for sure. And you\'re like, okay, I want to give back, but I, can\'t just, I\'m not a nonprofit, I\'m a profit in enterprise and everything, and I want to help with them and contribute to these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But something you mentioned just a second ago was pinged for my second thought. And when you said next generation, the no, our intern Here and has helping to post that by the way. But I also know your passion, heart for next generation with WordPress too. And it, that just brings up, well, one Sandy Edwards work with kids camp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk to her about that a couple of weeks ago at our three, how post-test wants to contribute to that. But the other thing, the second theme is Gutenberg. You know, you can\'t probably talk to Matt about WordPress without hearing Gutenberg and for good reason, here\'s the thing. I was not a vocal advocate at all of ruling out Gutenberg in the way we did&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I like how politically, that was so eloquently put, but yes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, I thought it was way early and everything, and it took me a year or two to finally [00:12:00] okay. You know, use Gutenberg and but it here\'s the reality situation, no matter what, the way we feel about the past, it is here and it\'s not going away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you hear this over and over from Matt and for good reasons, there\'s some cool stuff coming. That he talked about the styles, some of the typical libraries. I see that as a very similar innovation and direction, that themes as a whole went when I started, I think back in 2008, There\'s so much innovation to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So first and foremost, it\'s here. We\'ve got to accept it and move on. And I think what his plea here was too, and again, probably my nuance. It\'s not, I\'m not going to play, but I\'m just saying my nuances. It\'s not going away. We should accept it and embrace it. And then the question becomes, how do we improve that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think our community can make considerable contribution. To the conversation and the actual implementation of Gutenberg, the block editor for WordPress. I\'ll tell ya, I\'m looking, I\'m going to redo my [00:13:00] personal site cause I want to start blogging every day. And I say blogging, it\'s going to be just sharing my thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not just on Twitter, but you know, my site and I\'m probably going to pig blank canvas. I\'m still up in the air and I want to use. And I want to really like embrace using it and see what I, what my takeaways are. And I did that back in August with the click publish. I want to use Gutenberg because I\'ve criss cross the threshold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for me, I\'ll tell you the big benefit David was used to because no one even believes I\'m ever been a developer. I\'m not, but I was like&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Don\'t be ashamed. I\'m a programmer. I do websites. I do plug-ins. I do all of that. And what does Matt say to everybody that I am during state of the word?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tweet a lot. So that\'s my claim to fame. That\'ll be on my tombstone where the developer, but you\'re not a developer, but&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I was looking for, I wanted to do a buy now button or something. You know, I just wanted to button and I can\'t, I can [00:14:00] figure it out. I mean, I don\'t want to figure out how to write a button coordination, or, CSS or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I, what I normally would have done is went look for a plugin. I can\'t remember. I want to say max plugins or something was that max buttons was out there as a plug in. Well, and I can\'t remember what might\'ve been AGA again. But it was like, that\'s a block that was a game changer for me to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\'t have to get something extra to do things you want to do in the post. That was pretty cool turning point for me. It\'s not there. It\'s getting better, this awesome people working on it. And I think we should. We can and should contribute to the conversation and the implementation once it gets going, because it\'s not going away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And back to your point about next generation Syed Balkhi that if you WP Beginner and awesome motive, I remember asking him a couple of years about Gutenberg. I was like I kind of expect he\'s going to get on the bandwagon. Let me it\'s like, we don\'t like it. It shouldn\'t be out there. And Syed was like, I love it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was like why? And he goes, because the next generation look at how people are [00:15:00] publishing today and it\'s changed from what you and I learned now. He\'s like, he\'s over 10 years, 15 years younger than me. But like even young kids like Olivia and like the platforms have changed in the way to express yourself change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that always stuck with me what Syed said. And so I really have high hopes for Gutenberg. Yeah, again, now that I am in strong, like of it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So another thing Matt talked about which I\'m actually a little bit surprised he did bring it up. I\'m wondering who, by the way, Tuesday was when WordPress 5.9 was supposed to be out before they pushed it to January. So I talked to Anne McCarthy today. And first of all, I mentioned to her, like you mentioned, like 5.0 release when Gutenberg first came up, was rough around the edges. And she has assured me that the full site editor coming out in January with 5.9 is it may not have the entire kitchen sink, but it is very stable and doable. So I can\'t wait to share that [00:16:00] interview with everybody, but Matt did call out acquisitions and I like, and I thought is this one of the things that if 5.9 was out, would he gone over more quickly? I don\'t know, but they got on one slide. He started with 42 logos. And I thought there were more acquisitions than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ll have to go back to our Post Status tracker. But he had 42 logos up there and then he proceeded with, and I\'m not a finance person. I\'m just going to take his word for it. , his charts were taken from other people\'s analysis. He gave proper credit to them, but he says the number of the deals that are happening in the tech space, he says there were 10,000 transactions in the first nine months of 2021 alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is up 24% over the last year. And then he brought out another chart that was called inflows to stocks. And I couldn\'t even, I don\'t even know what that was. I was, but all I know is there was a big bar at the end with the, with our year in it though. And I guess what he was trying to prove is that [00:17:00] don\'t panic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The acquisition space is not unique to the WordPress space right now. This is all going, you know, bonkers. And it\'s not just WordPress. So I, you know, with you being a business person, how did you feel, do you feel that was properly delivered or delivered? Well, do you think he got the message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> But the question I think about that is what prompted him to even do the slides, you know, and that\'s the bigger question we always want to be thinking about here, you know, for our people is what is the founder co-founder of WordPress, the movement of open source project. Fill the need to say that. And we have some sense of the people that are like change sucks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody likes change, you know, and the fact of the matter, if you bullet down these acquisitions, why would anybody even care? It\'s because it could potentially change something that I\'m used to doing. And I\'m not saying it\'s good, right? Bad, wrong indifferent. I\'m just saying, you know, I think change is [00:18:00] tough and I\'ve heard some sentiment from the WordPress community about, I don\'t even recognize it anymore and all this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I just go down, like, here\'s my comparison for it is when I left.iThemes and started this new journey and Post Status . It was over a year before I became a partner and it was probably nine months before Brian and I even started talking about me becoming a partner. There was a big gap there and I was like, I didn\'t know what I was going to do next and trying to figure that out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I did one simple thing, which was, I\'m never going to say publicly privately, I\'m leaving WordPress. I joked all the time. I\'m going to be a WordPress user a blogger, which I was still am. But the important thing is I didn\'t want to lose or even think all the amazing friendships I\'ve made over 15 years being in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To say, I\'m saying goodbye to you. That\'s not it. You heard Pippin Williamson when he left Sandhill dev that he was like, I\'m not saying about a difference, but I need to step away from the project. [00:19:00] And I just go that sentiment to me comes back to this acquisition. Like things are changing, all that stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I totally get that. I\'m not trying to change your emotion. My way of thinking about it though, is the people are still here and that\'s what matters. I\'ve known you David for God. Has it been 10 years since&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ve known you for 10 years?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Since the first conference in Arizona whose name is escaping my. I think that\'s where we may have known.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may have known each other prior to that. That\'s the first time we met in person, I think officially,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> but you know, the premise of all, this is like, the people are still here, for the most part. Now you\'re always going to get people leaving the ecosystem, leaving it, you know, and coming in new people, coming in, who I met, one of our post-test members was when Stina and I\'d love to hear her story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was there. Got invited to State of the Word we got to talk Post Status member and That\'s a new person, I didn\'t know, a year ago or two years ago, you [00:20:00] know? And so some may leave and you\'re always going to have that in some, and cause there was even a picture. I think one of those slides, David of Kim. Oh, you know, and you think about people who have left and for instance, this world Kim back in the day but I saw her picture on one of those slides, you know, and it made me smile, but all that to say, WordPress is not about code it\'s about the people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is what I hang on. I\'m not trying to change your heart, your feelings, but I\'m just saying, if you think about it, go it\'s about the people. No matter if it\'s a team, if it\'s outside of WordPress, whatever it is, it\'s like, what matters are the people there? And are we growing together and all that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that\'s the way I think about that, but that the merger is that it\'s I it\'s right for people to go and question what\'s what the heck\'s going on here. Things are changing on that space, but I still go the Michelle Frechette. Actually as a team member of people, some of my best friends and my former team and I themes now, is that interesting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I\'ve known Michelle for a long time and now she\'s a part of the scene. That\'s cool. You know, that, that change happened where gives, [00:21:00] got by. And cellar rolled out and she moved over roles and now we get to work with her Post Status too. And again, I just call back to, if you\'re worried about that, just go back to the people now there\'s other worries, but I just, the heart of it is about people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah. And&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also, I have also have a motto too, in terms of you don\'t let the people that are leaving a community, distract you from who is coming into the community or who they should, or who should be invited into the community and vice versa. But don\'t let one side distract you from who\'s coming in versus who\'s going out and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think we\'re doing a pretty good job with that. What happened after state of the word after it ended what happened.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, so there was about, I can\'t remember how many, but at least 20 of us, I could probably adapt touch straight back to Post Status and we all kind of stayed at the same hotel and had a little, two day fun before the event and all that stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so a bunch of us went back to our hotel and we\'re at the restaurant, the hotel restaurant bar, [00:22:00] and just kinda talking, you know, and I got to meet great people. I\'ve just met in like Robert. Who runs OSTP training there? I got to see again for the third time, Robert Jacoby of cloud waves. The hero press couple Kate, and Tofor, I\'m trying to think of othersAC Morse was there? Gravity forms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Aaron Campbell was there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> The Aaron and I laughed. He lives in Oklahoma. Like me, he\'s literally an hour away. I bet it\'d take me 45 minutes to be on his doorstep and vice versa. And we\'re like, we had to laugh. So we\'re sitting in New York city Soho, somewhere in the coffee shop. We\'re like, isn\'t it funny how we have to either go out of the country or to go across the states to see each other when we live like that close to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I love Aaron. He has such a great. For WordPress, all things WordPress and I love what he\'s doing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Bob was there too. Of course, he traveled by train. He traveled by training the width of the Wu train clan. And it was, I think one of the best moments of the night was when he got up to ask the question and he had the simplest of questions, which was like, he [00:23:00] like, what\'s up for WooCommerce or in the next year I traveled 2000 miles to ask this question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And how did Matt respond&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> that\'s all the bingo card and slack Post Status slack light up because Bob asked it, you know, finally he got the invoke. Woo. Yeah. I love Bob. Bob does and has been around for a long time too. And what I said about him personally at the vent was the one thing I admire about him is he has just consistently showed up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And get work in this space and has mad respect from everybody because of it. So we sponsored his train trip out because we wanted to I mean, Bob is such a vital member of the WordPress community and then specifically WooCommerse. So Bob did all of that kind of community logistic, wrangling there, in addition to being like, and he was trying to record, he set up a studio in his room and I got to be with Robbie and Robert and Bob and</p>\n\n\n\n<p>do the woo podcasts there. So, it was a great time for that on the note of getting people together. And Post Status [00:24:00] specifically we\'re right now getting our in person. Camps together for Post Status Brian and intended to do it last year. And you know what, two years ago, and you know what happened, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this year we\'re putting some plans in place to get together in a small way to talk shop, to do life together as a community. I would love for everybody to be there next. December 22nd for, it\'s going to&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> say, as we wrap up here, what is the schedule look like for our post status members?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do they, pay attention to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So we\'re doing a year in, remember huddle. We\'re going to be doing these next year, by the way, in which I\'ll be talking about, but our member huddle you\'re in next Wednesday, December 22nd, 11:00 AM central time. There\'ll be zoom links in slack and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so. We\'re going to do our, that member huddle. How-to it\'s going to be one part like reflective review last year, thinking about next year. So look back, look forward, and then we\'re going to do some fun stuff. I want you to meet the Post Status team. All the people that are doing all this crazy awesome [00:25:00] stuff behind the scenes that you don\'t all see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then talk about some of the things we got in store for our Post Status community. A couple of times I\'ve heard people say energy with post status and it is, and it ain\'t just me, by the way, it\'s people like David who had been here faithfully for years, Michelle Frechette, Courtney Robertson, Taleesha, you\'ll get to meet her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She\'s our new director of operations and all kinds of people in between. I can\'t wait to do that. And then laugh together. Our theme for the ongoing, I hesitate to say it\'s going to be 2022, because I just want it to be forever is give. Together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> What was that again?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Give, grow together. It\'s part of what I want to be our member mantra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing we come to post to us and say, I\'m here to give of myself my time, talent, treasure, all that stuff. Not true necessarily, but like give up myself in the spirit of open source to the commuity. To each other. Second is I\'m here to grow. I want to grow myself. I want to grow my business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to grow my career. We\'ve got specific plans for the growth side and then together, it\'s [00:26:00] just the thing that wraps everything together. It\'s not I. It\'s not you. It\'s always, we at Post Status. It\'s not just me. I happen to be on, you know, I had my face out there and stuff like that. But if this is truly a community and truly a team too, and I want us to just emphasize those three things, give in spirit of WordPress, same thing, just give to each other in the community business of WordPress second is to grow commit. You want to be here, let\'s grow yourself, grow professionally, grow your business, whatever it is, come here to grow. And then to do it together do it all of us together. So, even our products, like, as you will know David is called and that\'s a Portuguese word for probably mispronounced it, but together we\'re together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\'s been a theme of my life even before clinical campaigns and the COVID time. But I really mean it next year as I\'m going to do these things from in-person camps, how we do slack, how we do some of the cohorts, we\'re going to be rolling out. And I hope you\'ll show up next week and we can talk more about that and get your feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> What was the date again?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> [00:27:00] December 22nd.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So December 22nd, Wednesday, are we going to see any sign of a state of post status with you in a suit? Is that something we can look forward to?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> You\'re probably not the second&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> the people that are listening for the people that are listening at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory shook his head so quickly that I thought his neck was about to snap.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, I think we should do these types of things where as our leader of post, as getting in front listing talk, discuss, put things out there that help you learn and grow and all that with postdocs, for sure. And I always want to get to Canada.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe to the first to the second one, the suit, you know, I mean, I\'ve got two suits. I probably don\'t fit currently. So. I think you\'re more likely to see me in a Chewbacca outfit than a suit, but no shady. Anybody else? It\'s just,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> no, you have to stand up. You gotta make yourself stand out with all these other state of the blah-blah-blah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, if Matt does a [00:28:00] suit, I think. Any, if you\'re going to wear a hairy Chewbacca outfit, I think that\'s a good countermove. But anyway,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Somebody is gonna remember this and come back and say, Cory memory, you say you do that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Oh, people will remember it. I might have a little bit of a night terror about it. I\'ve got a thing against Wookiees. But other than that, I think it\'s a fantastic idea. Well, it sounds like you had a blast and it was a blast watching. I see you in some of the photos. Sometimes you\'re in the background You\'re in the background photo bombing. It\'s fantastic. I\'m glad that this happened and I\'m glad to see Matt so open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it was because it was a smaller venue or it was the fact that there wasn\'t a word campy west surrounding Matt. You know how draining that is even to, just to be at a work camp us and then, and that WordCamp us with a talk in front of a thousand, 2000 people, it would look like a really nice event with a ton of energy, but.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personable intimate. And I\'m glad you all in this, in the few got to experience that. And I, of course, next year though, [00:29:00] or next time this happens, hopefully it will be under different circumstances and we\'ll have more people. In fact, think he said, if all goes well, San Diego is going to be the work camp spot for 20, 22.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever been to Sandy? Oh, really? I\'ve never been. So it\'ll be interesting for me. Was there anything else that you wanted to share? I think we, it was good seeing you. It was good seeing you. I\'m glad you\'re home safe. And then it sounded like they do all the safety precautions and everything, which was fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m glad they did that. And it was good to see Josepha and the others there as well representing so great. So next time. Let\'s it sounds like we\'re going to talk about wrapping up our thoughts about the year with the biggest news stories that you think Corey or the most influential to you personally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we\'ve asked the same question to our post status members, this awesome service zip message. I want to say zap message, but that sounds more painful. Zip message. It\'s zip message. And we\'re encouraging people [00:30:00] to go in there and just leave a brief clip about what story to them was the most influential for WordPress this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to them personally, and maybe by the time we talk next time, we will have a couple of us to talk about and share our own as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Thanks, david. And thanks everybody.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 04:32:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"David Bisset\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 12.2 Focuses on User Experience Improvements\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=127612\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:173:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-12-2-focuses-on-user-experience-improvements?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gutenberg-12-2-focuses-on-user-experience-improvements\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5854:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Some Gutenberg plugin releases feel like heavy-hitters with new user-facing features. Others, such as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/12/22/whats-new-in-gutenberg-12-2-22-december/\">today&#8217;s version 12.2 update,</a> smooth over problems and create a more well-rounded experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching between the site editor and templates is smoother. The color picker is no longer a hot mess. And, border controls now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34061\">use the tools panel</a> approach of allowing users to enable or disable the options they want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors have made progress on updating the Comments Query Loop block, which will eventually be the backbone of displaying comments in block themes. One of the tallest hurdles was <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36065\">making nested comments work</a>. With that now fixed, moving forward with other comment-related components should be less problematic. The latest release also introduced the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36890\">Comments Pagination Numbers block</a> for handling paginated comment lists.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"view-templates-without-a-page-reload\">View Templates Without a Page Reload</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Templates view in the site editor.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">When <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-12-1-fixes-block-appender-layout-shift-adds-template-list-views-and-enhances-global-styles\">Gutenberg 12.1</a> launched two weeks ago, I was happy to see the new and much improved slide-out panel in the site editor for viewing templates. My primary complaint: it was slow. Switching between the editor and template view required a page reload.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the latest 12.2 release, this has all changed. Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36488\">client-side routing in the site editor</a>, the transition between the editor and templates feels fast and smooth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Changes like this are one of the reasons I have welcomed the postponement of WordPress 5.9 until late January. Some of these little wrinkles needed ironing before showing the site editor to the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"improved-color-picker\">Improved Color Picker</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Color picker popup.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gutenberg 12.2 introduces a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37067\">much-improved color picker</a>. The previous iteration was unwieldy, bulky to the point of being an annoyance. Users would have to scroll and scroll and scroll some more just to jump between changing a block&#8217;s text color and its link color. This was especially true if the theme showed both its colors and those from core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest iteration tightens up the UI to the point where users can see the text, background, and link color options all at once. If they want to customize any of them, they can click on one to pull up the color picker popup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps this change will open the door for other color options in the future, such as one for link hover/focus. It would have been far too messy in the old UI. However, the new minimalist design leaves ample room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would love to see the border-color control get the same treatment. However, there is a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/35602\">separate ticket</a> that offers more fine-tuned control.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"font-size-ui-change\">Font Size UI Change</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Numbered-style font-size selector.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The font size control for supported blocks looks much different. It shows a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37038\">list of numbered buttons</a> for themes with five or fewer custom sizes. The font-size name appears when one is selected. Otherwise, it is simply a list of numbers with no context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have generally liked the progress made toward updating the block options UI. But, I am not a fan of this change. As a user, what do these numbers even mean? Is the &#8220;1&#8221; size small or medium? There is no way of knowing without testing it. Plus, the context will change from theme to theme. A UI change like this may have been OK on the back of a standardized naming scheme. However, that will be tough to implement after three years of usage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, clicking a single button feels like a better experience than clicking a dropdown, followed by a second click of making a selection. I am just not sure that it works here. However, I am open to seeing where it goes upon further iteration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also no visible way to clear the current selection and return to the default size. If the theme supports custom sizes, users can switch to the &#8220;Custom&#8221; field and clear it out. This is not obvious unless you stumble upon it. Users could also hit the &#8220;Reset All&#8221; button, but doing so resets all typography options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to avoid this UI change is for theme authors to register at least six custom font sizes. The option will automatically revert to its former dropdown select field. Fortunately, I have 13 in the theme I primarily work on, so it is a non-issue for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-template-part-hooks\">Block Template Part Hooks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Theme and plugin developers now have <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36884\">additional action hooks</a> around the block template part system.

She proposed three different release schedules: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Quarterly releases: January, April, July, October</li><li>Trimester-ly releases: January, May, September</li><li>Known release and then evenly spaced targets?: January, May, August, November</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When she <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1639001383392000\">brought it up in the #core Slack channel</a>, a few contributors said they would like to see the project move towards more frequent releases. They were optimistic that it can be done, since a January release is already on the schedule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Responses to the post on make.wordpress.org were markedly different. A few commented that they would be comfortable with a quarterly releases as long as they avoid major holidays. Several participants in the conversation have urged WordPress to slow down to two or three releases. Others suggested WordPress simply wait to release new features until they are ready, with no schedule. This particular suggestion makes it difficult for various stakeholders, like hosting companies, agencies, and WordPress product businesses, to plan effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, WordPress released version 5.7 in March and 5.8 in July. A third major release planned for December was postponed due to critical blockers and decreased volunteer availability. A jump to four releases next year seems overly ambitious without a change in processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Is it realistic to plan four releases for 2022 right after three releases per year plan was not fulfilled?&#8221; Oleg Kharchenko asked in the comments. &#8220;I don’t get what’s the benefit of having more releases just for the sake of number. It looks good in business reports but it has no real value for WordPress users as frequent releases lead to half-baked features which are hard to use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Also plugin and theme authors will have to put more time into testing instead of their product development. Finally, there are many tickets on Trac with &#8216;early&#8217; keyword which are punted for years just because everybody is too busy to find time to include these tickets in the upcoming release, making the release schedule tighter would worsen this situation even more.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jessica Lyschik, a developer and an active member of the German WordPress community, said she would prefer two releases for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As several people already mentioned, planning more releases did not work out in the past, so why should it work now?&#8221; Lyschik asked. &#8220;5.9 got postponed to have refined features included so it can be actually used. The complexity of the new features is huge and trying to split that up in smaller releases is not something I see to work in the future.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The roadmap for 2021 originally planned for four major releases but was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-contributors-discuss-scaling-back-releases-4-major-releases-is-not-a-viable-plan-in-2021\">scaled back to three in February</a>. At that time Haden Chomphosy cited a lack of automation and the necessary personnel to execute the plan without risking contributor burnout and update fatigue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress core committer John Blackbourn commented on the discussion, urging Haden Chomphosy to elaborate on why she is proposing the potential of more frequent releases. He also requested she summarize the original list of challenges and needed changes and the progress that has been made towards improving them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a post titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://nomad.blog/2021/11/23/why-i-voted-to-delay-wordpress-5-9/\">Why I Voted to Delay WordPress 5.9</a>,&#8221; Anne McCarthy explained a few of the factors and blockers that caused the release to be postponed to January 2022. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What I’d like to understand better is what are we going to do to make sure this doesn’t happen again?&#8221; WordPress 5.9 release lead Matt Mullenweg commented. &#8220;There could always be more polish, more bugs fixed, and I would challenge you to pick a year in the past decade that didn’t have its share of human issues. I’d like us to really understand and agree what went wrong, particularly in the first months of 5.9, and what we’re starting now to make sure 6.0 is effortlessly on time.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McCarthy responded, citing the following reasons: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>lack of contingency plans around the interrelated features </li><li>lack of clarity around scope for various individual features (particularly the browsing feature) </li><li>lack of a comprehensive check in early enough ahead of feature freeze </li><li>a need for more decision makers who have a high level view of where the work is headed</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Personally, I’d love to see the Go/No Go meeting overhauled to be less aspirational and more concrete as to where things stand as I think that’ll set the tone early enough in the release cycle to avoid some of these problems again,&#8221; McCarthy said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few of these challenges with 5.9 correspond to the items Haden Chomphosy identified in February as needing to change in order to make WordPress releases easier and more frequent: better testing, more seasoned core developers available with time focused on core, better handoff in design/dev iterations, and shifts in collective philosophies towards continuous development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the absence of a comprehensive 5.9 retrospective, it may be difficult to plan the next year&#8217;s release schedule based on the reality of what contributors experienced most recently. Moving to four major releases will be a tough sell after closing out a year where WordPress could not post three major releases. It will require significant changes to how the work is scoped and managed as it is in process. The topic will be up for discussion again during today&#8217;s weekly core dev chat at 20:00 UTC.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 19:50:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"HeroPress: Living Well and Enabling Success For Others Through WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=4328\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:196:\"https://heropress.com/essays/living-well-and-enabling-success-for-others-through-wordpress/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=living-well-and-enabling-success-for-others-through-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12420:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/122121-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Success is a life well lived.\" /><p>From a very young age, I can remember dreaming about a business I would one day own. It would be a restaurant named “The Comfy Chair.” Serving mainly breakfast and light lunch, I pictured a funky space with a mix of unique, comfortable chairs. Patrons could choose the chair that fit their mood of the day.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m sorry to report that my childhood dream never came true.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Instead, I now lead a 15-person remote team that develops open source software on WordPress, our primary product is the membership plugin <a href=\"https://www.paidmembershipspro.com\">Paid Memberships Pro</a>.</p>\n<p>The road that led me to WordPress didn’t begin with a passion for the web, or democratizing publishing, or coding, or anything technology-related.</p>\n<p>I began my career in WordPress through my passion for entrepreneurship. A passion to control my earnings, “be my own boss,” and maybe more specifically, work when I want, on what I want, and for the price I choose.</p>\n<blockquote><p>That is the most kickass thing about WordPress—people can enter our community and leverage WordPress for free, from anywhere, anytime, for any reason.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>From Craigslist to Plugins</h2>\n<p>Throughout college, I freelanced doing simple brochure websites, graphic design, and a lot of print work. I used Craigslist and word of mouth to get projects, taking nearly any job that a) paid and b) I could handle on my own or with some help from my “high school sweetheart, husband, co-founder, and best friend” Jason.</p>\n<p>After graduation, my parents were cautiously enthusiastic about my decision to start a web design business. I knew I had many months of runway and felt it was a no brainer. Starting a business is a risk. The bigger risk was missing the opportunity to create my own business in the “carefree” days of youth.</p>\n<p>Business ownership teaches you a ton—I was learning not just about emerging web technologies like WordPress. I had to learn every aspect of small business: sales and marketing, project scoping, invoicing and accounts receivable, taxes, healthcare…everything.</p>\n<p>In Fall 2006, Jason left his job at Accenture and joined me full time. I had my projects and clients, Jason had his. He led the projects that were more development-focused, I led the more design-focused projects.</p>\n<p>By 2007, we started doing WordPress sites almost exclusively. WordPress was about four years old at the time. The community was starting to take shape. Meetups and WordCamps were becoming a thing, but the events were very different back then.</p>\n<p>I didn’t identify with the early WordPress community. Events were primarily attended by developers and coders, who were primarily male. So I stayed on the periphery of the community.</p>\n<p>Jason and I continued operating Stranger Studios as a two-person team. In an agency, there are two main ways to grow revenue: charge more per hour or bill more hours (grow the team). I couldn’t picture myself <i>managing other people</i>. Life and business was good just the way it was. So we regularly raised rates, focused on high value clients, and tried our best not to keep too many clients on maintenance plans.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The WordPress “CMS” helped us increase the number of clients we could serve by giving them more independence in managing their own sites.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then, life decided to push me into my next chapter with an event that happened when we had our first child, Isaac.</p>\n<h2>A Building Block For Change</h2>\n<p>Isaac had a rough start to life 13 years ago and needed surgery a day after his birth. We are endlessly grateful to St. Christopher’s Hospital and The Philadelphia Ronald McDonald House for supporting us through his first two weeks.</p>\n<p>And while going through those heartbreaking, chaotic, and hopeful weeks, <i>we still had to work</i>. I remember waiting in our hotel room for Jason to wrap up an urgent call with a client so we could go see our days-old baby. It’s a ridiculous scene to reflect on.</p>\n<p>I thought I was living life my way. In reality, I was financially tying myself to a handful of long-term clients. And what’s worse: there was no one to hand things off to when my personal life needed attention.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Consulting work felt like being on call 24/7.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That event changed my life in more ways than I could ever put into words. For the intention of this essay, let’s just say that our business needed to change dramatically, quickly.</p>\n<p>When I talk with other entrepreneurs and business owners, we often break down the differences between a services company and a product company. You may have heard a WordPress talk on this very topic: the move from “consulting to products”.</p>\n<p>It’s an appealing path for many WordPressers. And now that I’m on the other side of the transition, I can’t deny it is an awesome space to be in—even with the product space going through some major shifts with all the acquisition activity. But that’s a topic for another conversation entirely…</p>\n<p>The biggest turning point in my WordPress journey was the decision to create a product. By moving to a product company, I could make more money without working 24 hours a day or (immediately) having to hire people and grow as an agency.</p>\n<p>But what kind of product should we build? What untapped market could we serve? What was missing in the WordPress ecosystem?</p>\n<p>We found the answer by looking at our history of proposals and projects.</p>\n<p>A growing number of our freelance projects had a “membership-type” component. People wanted to protect access to features of their site (content, tools, applications). People wanted to get paid through their WordPress site. More specifically, they wanted to “make money while they sleep” and get paid on a recurring basis. Sell once, get paid over and over again.</p>\n<p>Jason and I recognized this trend and the lack of a leading WordPress plugin for memberships. We focused only on freelance projects for “membership-type” sites built on WordPress. These projects helped us bootstrap the development of what is now Paid Memberships Pro.</p>\n<h2>Open Source Products Are Better Products</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I believe in open source. I believe open source products are better products.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We release all of our products with an open source license, just like WordPress. We make our code publicly available on GitHub in a format that removes barriers to collaboration for internal and external contributors. And we make a very good living for ourselves and our team by building a business on top of our open source products.</p>\n<p>The decision to be open source has made an overwhelmingly positive impact on the growth of our business. But there’s another major reason why we’ve made it in the WordPress product space.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Paid Memberships Pro is a success in large part because we release the full version for free in the WordPress.org Plugins repository.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Putting my beliefs in OSS aside, the repo makes your plugin available for every WordPress site. That’s <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress\">43.1% of websites</a> that exist today. The repo is an amazing resource for every site <i>using</i> WordPress and also for every <i>business</i> building a WordPress product. Not only does the repo facilitate installs and updates, it also builds in a layer of security for WordPress users.</p>\n<p>I am deeply grateful for the WordPress community members (the Plugins team) that maintains, reviews, and supports the repository. Without you, I wouldn’t be sitting here today writing an essay about my WordPress journey.</p>\n<h2>Building a Team That’s Diverse In Many Ways</h2>\n<p>I’ve always been a woman business owner in a male-dominated field. But I can’t say that my being a woman was something that limited or, on the flip side, catapulted my career forward.</p>\n<p>I say this because there are many people in the WordPress community that speak intelligently and openly about important topics like diversity, inclusion, and the serious problem of underrepresentation. I have not devoted enough time to educate myself on their efforts.</p>\n<p>But as a person who has interviewed and hired people for a variety of roles, I do have some perspective on the value diversity has brought to our team.</p>\n<p>Nearly half of our team are women. And we are diverse in other ways including age, geography, physical ability, and experience.</p>\n<p>I value diversity as I value any other positive trait that an employee brings to the table.</p>\n<p>When I am interviewing another woman, I recognize that they bring a woman&#8217;s perspective to the team, which is valuable. When I am interviewing someone with very little experience, I recognize that I can teach anyone that’s willing to learn and grow, which is valuable. When I am interviewing someone that lives a 20-hour plane ride away, I know that we work remotely and don’t have to overlap for our entire work day.</p>\n<p>The diversity in our team has changed my worldview. I have learned endless things about other cultures, such as the troubling issues that a Nigerian mother has faced to find a safe and enriching school for her daughter. I’ve learned about the lasting effects of apartheid in South Africa, about the progess has been made to unify the country and where there is work to be done.</p>\n<p>As a parent of “tweens”, I’ve learned valuable lessons from people with adult children. And on the flip side, I’ve shared my stories with people at an earlier stage in the parenting journey.</p>\n<p>WordPress is an open, free, accessible tool used by the whole world. Getting involved in WordPress doesn’t require a special form of education, grasp of the English language, or boatloads of money.</p>\n<p>I wouldn’t have been able to build a diverse team if the WordPress community, itself, wasn’t diverse.</p>\n<h2>Live Your Way</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Live your life your way. Do more of the things you want. Do less of the things you don’t want.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I am extremely grateful that I am safe, comfortable, and able to live my life, my way. I know that many people are in a place where this type of thinking is not possible.</p>\n<p>But even people with everything can have a feeling that something is missing. For me, that feeling is influenced by what <i>other people want for me</i>, when I feel pressure to live out <i>someone else’s dream</i>.</p>\n<p>Jason tells me (and others) that my skills are wasted on this product. He boosts me up with encouragement and praise. He says that I am capable of bigger, grander things.</p>\n<p>The message I take from this is that I can do anything. So I will do what I want to do. I will do more of the things I like to do, and less of the things I don’t.</p>\n<p>In work, that looks like filling senior roles on our team to do things I am currently responsible for. Freeing up my time to nurture the next big product. Or, freeing up my time to spend in ways that my kids need me. Or, I could get another dog.</p>\n<p>What I want to leave you with here is that you don’t have to feel pressured to go after someone else’s dream. I’ve watched companies like mine get acquired. Their founders take extended vacations and are living semi-retired lives. I think “is this what I’m supposed to do next?”</p>\n<p>Then I join my team on a call and I think “I never want to stop working with these people. This is my family.”</p>\n<p>I’ve had opportunities to swing for the fences. To push harder. To get bigger, faster. To be wildly successful.</p>\n<p>This is a monetary measure of success. This is feeling successful because other people think you are.</p>\n<p>To me, success isn’t measured by dollars or ego. Success is a life well lived. I want to energetically pursue living well. I want to build products that help people find this success. I want to grow a team that has the same freedoms in life that I humbly enjoy.</p>\n<p>I want to keep pursuing success with WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 13:00:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Kim Coleman\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Ask the Bartender: Will It Become Easier To Create Block Patterns?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=127545\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:193:\"https://wptavern.com/ask-the-bartender-will-it-become-easier-to-create-block-patterns?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ask-the-bartender-will-it-become-easier-to-create-block-patterns\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4048:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Do you know if WordPress FSE is working to make it easier to create block patterns? Templates and Parts need to just click a button to download them. But patterns are very manual, and you need to register all of them programmatically.</p><cite>Thiago</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">You are not the first person to ask this question, and it is something that I have been mulling over for a while. With <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-next-generation-of-wordpress-theme-authors-will-design-from-the-site-editor\">theme development quickly encroaching</a> a point where it could almost exclusively be done via the site editor, it makes sense that block patterns follow along with their template counterparts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature has not been given any sort of official green light. I am not aware of a specific ticket for it, but it seems like it will be a part of the natural evolution of themes and patterns. I encourage opening a new ticket via the Gutenberg GitHub directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two core features need to precede it:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A standard folder for storing patterns in themes.</li><li>A way to save patterns in the database.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, there are tickets for both of these. Last month, Gutenberg lead Matías Ventura opened a new issue for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/36548\">standardizing how themes are organized</a>. WordPress 5.9 will see the introduction of <code>/templates</code> and <code>/parts</code> folders for templates and template parts, respectively. These will be the officially-supported locations in block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That same ticket proposes future enhancements of a <code>/styles</code> folder for global style variations and <code>/patterns</code> for block patterns. Having a standard location for these things is vital because the exporter in the site editor needs to know where to put them in the exported ZIP file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A side benefit of this feature is that theme authors would no longer be required to register their custom patterns via PHP. They could merely drop the files into their <code>/patterns</code> folders and move on. The format of this is nowhere near official at this point. There is an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36751\">unmerged pull request</a> that implements this by searching file headers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second piece of solving this issue is figuring out how to allow users to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/31298\">save patterns via the UI</a> similarly to reusable blocks. This is a more complex issue. There are existing plugins that already do this, such as my own <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-pattern-builder/\">Block Pattern Builder</a>, which sorely needs updating, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/blockmeister/\">BlockMeister</a>, a more robust solution. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/reusable-blocks-extended/\">Reusable Blocks Extended</a> even allows users to convert reusable blocks into patterns. So, there are already folks who are trying to solve the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still questions about the implementation before it can be officially supported. Are saved patterns a subtype of <code>wp_block</code>, which is currently the post type for reusable blocks? Are they something separate? Then, the project must also decide whether it wants to allow custom pattern categories via a new taxonomy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also other considerations before adding another feature into core, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/32682\">adding a design library</a> for components in the global space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are not quite to the point where you want, but we are on the path. The <code>/patterns</code> folder alone would remove the code-writing requirement. If it lands in WordPress, you could copy and paste block HTML over. It is not the same as exporting them alongside templates, but I hope the platform arrives at that destination one day.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 01:36:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.9 Beta 4\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11876\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/12/wordpress-5-9-beta-4/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5144:\"<p>WordPress 5.9 Beta 4 is now available for testing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software version is still under development.</strong> Please do not run this software on a production site; install it on a test site, where you can try out the newest features and get a feel for how they will work on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the WordPress 5.9 Beta 4 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Install and activate the<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\"> <strong>WordPress Beta Tester</strong></a><strong> </strong>plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Direct download the beta version here (<strong><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.9-beta4.zip\">zip</a></strong>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> When using WP-CLI to upgrade from Beta 1, 2, or 3 to Beta 4 on a case-insensitive filesystem, please use the following command sequence:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Command One:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>wp core update --version=5.9-beta4</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Command Two:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>wp core update --version=5.9-beta4 --force</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The current target for the final release of 5.9 is January 25, 2022, which is only five weeks away.

Officially, it has not yet &#8220;fully launched.&#8221; However, it is live on the site, and anyone with an account can submit their photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus far, the directory has 103 submissions and are under the CC0 license. Unfortunately, there is only a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/photo/21761b9297/\">single photo of a house cat</a>. <em>Perhaps I will need to contribute to the commons that this project has made possible.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a separate project from <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/creative-commons-search-is-now-openverse\">Openverse</a>, a search engine for finding open-source media, launched before the State of the Word event. Eventually, images from WordPress Photos should be discoverable via the Openverse search.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year, I was already envisioning <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/openverse-why-this-project-is-good-for-wordpress-and-the-web\">what Openverse could be</a>. However, what I really wanted was a WordPress photo directory. Actually, I wanted a WordPress media directory, but starting with images is easier:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Openverse must become more than a media search engine. It needs to be a project where the Average Joe can upload a nice nature picture he took over the weekend barbecue. A place where Average Jane can share a video clip of the ocean waves hitting the shoreline from her beach trip. And a place where professionals can pay it forward to the world.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When Jeff Chandler of WP Mainline <a href=\"https://wpmainline.com/2021/12/17/submitted-my-first-photo-to-the-wordpress-cc-0-photo-directory/\">shared his first photo</a>, I quickly turned it into a block pattern that wrapped the image in a wooden frame (pattern and image links <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/justintadlock/86251f6641c0f3110f7682e1644b28c9\">available via Gist</a>). When the WordPress pattern directory opens its submission process, I would love to submit it or some variation.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Wooden frame block pattern around Chandler&#8217;s image.\n\n\n\n<p>My customization was not anything special. I wanted to showcase how vital CC0 photos are to those building WordPress extensions like patterns and themes. Having a reliable image resource is invaluable to our creator community. It also gives non-developers another way to contribute to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also like seeing the faces of people I know listed in the directory. It very much feels like a photo directory made by the people of WordPress. One of my favorites is this <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/photo/13461c0ff9/\">one from Topher DeRosia</a> (he has already submitted five):</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Single image posts provide additional photo information, categories, and tags. Each photo also has multiple download sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The front page and search could still use a little work. Being able to at least search for images based on orientation (e.g., landscape vs. portrait) would be helpful. A nav menu with all of the categories would be handy too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-space-needed-disruption\">The Space Needed Disruption</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The stock imagery space needed to be turned upside down. More and more, creators from the WordPress community have stepped away from some of the sites they once loved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/unsplash-responds-to-image-licensing-concerns-clarifies-reasons-for-hotlinking-and-tracking\">Unsplash.</a> <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2018/11/29/pexels-images-are-no-more-allowed/\">Pexels.</a> <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/01/13/pixabay-images-are-not-allowed/\">Pixabay.</a> They have all had an opportunity to become the most significant open-source photo website in the world. They are places for snagging a quick photograph for free. And, for the most part, they have allowed people to give back with their art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, these stock photo sites that previously distributed images in the public domain began adding restrictive licensing terms. It <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2017/06/30/theme-review-meeting-summary-june-27-2017/\">started with Unsplash</a> in 2017. Pexels soon followed, and Pixabay was in lock-step with the others by 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of these restrictions disallow users to build similar &#8220;collection sites&#8221; with those same images, essentially creating a competing service. However, they all have other restrictive terms on selling photos, especially unaltered ones. <em>Note: Pexels still allows its contributors to choose between the Pexels License and CC0 (public domain).</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many photo-sharing sites built their empires on top open source, only to turn their backs on it down the road. The open-source spirit embraces competing websites. The art itself is meant to be shared. That is kind of the point. To be fair, the aforementioned were not the only such sites. They were just the most prevalent in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress theme authors were often champions of those sites in years prior. However, they saw service after service disappear before their eyes as they were banned from use on WordPress.org. Themers could not distribute the images because the users who downloaded them would not have the same freedoms as promised by the GPL. It was a loss for open-source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that WordPress has a pattern directory, the issue has become more evident. In the coming months and years, creators will need high-quality photos to showcase their patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest path was to leverage the millions of people who use WordPress and build our own thing. WordPress Photos could very well become the <em>de facto</em> standard of open photos on the web, and that is something we should all welcome with open arms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project is necessary. WordPress.org has the resources to make something remarkable: a photo-sharing site that is 100% open and will never change.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 01:43:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 22: A Carol of Thanks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=11880\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/12/episode-22-a-carol-of-thanks/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5718:\"<p>In this last episode of 2021, Josepha Haden Chomphosy takes the time to appreciate those who make the WordPress project a success and offers a carol of thanks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project. Some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, ages and ages ago, when I first started this podcast, someone basically requested that Matt and I do a duet for the last podcast of the year. A Christmas carol duet; him on the saxophone and me on voice. I obviously did not get that coordinated I don&#8217;t even know why I said obviously. I&#8217;ll tell you right now I did not get that coordinated. I was a very busy lady this year. So I don&#8217;t have a Matt on saxophone. Still, I did think that maybe it might be nice just for me to sing a teensy little Christmas carol for you all just because it seems especially poignant the words this year, especially after the 2020, 2021 COVID, all the things and trying to get back in person. So I&#8217;m going to sing you all one little verse from <em>Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>01:35 <em>Singing</em>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have yourself a merry little Christmas</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let your heart be light</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From now on our troubles</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will be out of sight</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have yourself a merry little Christmas</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make the Yuletide gay</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From now on our troubles</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will be miles away</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we are as in olden days</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy golden days of yore</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faithful friends who are dear to us</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gather near to us, once more</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the years we all will be together</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the fates allow</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hang a shining star upon the highest bough</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And have yourself a merry little Christmas now</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we are as in olden days</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy golden days of yore</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faithful friends who are dear to us</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gather near to us, once more</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the years we all will be together</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the fates allow</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hang a shining star upon the highest bough</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And have yourself a merry little Christmas now</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, my friends, that was from my heart to yours if you happened to listen. If you skipped a few seconds to get through it, which I would totally understand, that is also fine. But I did want to just kind of wrap up the year to let you all know that I am so incredibly grateful for all of the people who show up for the WordPress project to make it a success. I have made so many friends and wonderful acquaintances throughout my time here with the WordPress project. And especially in my three years as the project&#8217;s Executive Director. You all have put a lot of trust in me and a lot of faith. And I know that we have gotten so much done together in the last few years. And I am equally sure that we&#8217;re going to get so much done in the years to come. And so thank you all so much for your continued work with WordPress and the way that you just bring your best at all times. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other little thanks I want to give. Over the course of this year, I&#8217;ve had an excellent team that works with me on this podcast. I have editing and design folks and people who&#8217;ve joined me here and there, folks who helped me with my production. So big thank you to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/dustinhartzler/\">Dustin</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/beafialho/\">Bea</a>, I realize your name is Beatriz in the actual credits, but I call you Bea, and so thank you. Also, a huge thank you to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\">Chloé</a>, who does all of our production and wrangling every couple of weeks. A big round of applause and kudos to that tiny but tough team that helps me get this all done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s to go on top of the general thanks to the WordPress project. And if you all are celebrators, I hope you have a wonderful holiday season.

There are likely dozens of plugins for disabling various items, each with its own unique set of options. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/no-nonsense/\">No Nonsense</a> is no different. It is a plugin that allows users to control whether they want to use over a dozen features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin was developed by <a href=\"https://room34.com/\">Room 34</a>, a Minneapolis-based web development and creative consulting studio. No Nonsense is the team&#8217;s 11th free plugin available through the WordPress.org plugin directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team&#8217;s plugin caught my eye because it has options for features that I routinely disable on WordPress site builds, such as emoji JavaScript, individual dashboard widgets, and the toolbar. Today&#8217;s update (version 1.2) even added an option to permanently remove the Hello Dolly plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before anyone asks &#8212; someone always asks &#8212;, the plugin does not disable the block editor. However, it does have an option for turning off the block-based widgets editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Room 34 released the plugin on Tuesday, so it has fewer than 10 active installs at the moment. It also does not have any reviews. I suppose this post will suffice as the first. Based on my experience and a peek at its code, the plugin looks solid.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Plugin settings screen.\n\n\n\n<p>I tested each feature and did not find any issues, so it gets a 5/5 for doing what it says on the tin. I would love to see a few more options.  One example that immediately comes to mind is the the &#8220;Posts&#8221; screen.  Since users can remove the &#8220;Comments&#8221; section in the admin, it makes sense to have a similar setting for posts. Both are related to blogging, and not all WordPress websites need them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No Nonsense includes one of my favorite admin-access limitations. It can redirect logged-in users to the homepage when accessing anything other than their user profile in the WordPress admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its toolbar options are all things I have lying around in my code toolbox. The plugin has settings for hiding it for users without editing access, removing the WordPress logo, and ditching the &#8220;Howdy&#8221; text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin includes options for many commonly-disabled features, but a new one that I had not thought about was the core update email. When managing sites for several family and friends, those &#8220;your site has updated to WordPress x.x.x&#8221; emails can become irritating. The plugin allows you to disable those except in cases of an error.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone has not already done so, I would love to see a <em>deactivation plugin to end all deactivation</em> plugins. It would feature a complete list of things that a site owner can turn off, disable, deactivate, remove, or whatever you want from a WordPress website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No Nonsense looks like a good starting place, but there are always other things that I might remove from an install. I almost always give the ax to the theme and plugin editors. As well as the plugin works, there&#8217;s always just a little something more I need to get rid of, depending on the site in question. So, I am still looking for that behemoth plugin that gives me that one-click access to disable anything.

His resignation followed a series of controversial remarks on rape, assault, and child sex trafficking, along with two decades of <a href=\"https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman\">behaviors and statements</a> that many have found to be disturbing and offensive. He was subsequently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gnu-project-maintainers-move-to-oust-richard-stallman-from-leadership\">ousted by GNU project maintainers</a> from his position as head of the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/free-software-community-condemns-richard-stallmans-reinstatement-to-fsf-board-of-directors\">Stallman&#8217;s controversial return</a> was supported by the majority of FSF&#8217;s board, with the exception of board member Kat Walsh who resigned after voting against his reinstatement. The organization’s executive director, deputy director, and chief technology officer also resigned in protest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, the FSF&#8217;s board published a statement saying they &#8220;take  full responsibility for how badly we handled the news of his election to a board seat. We had planned a flow of information that was not executed in a timely manner or delivered in the proper sequence.&#8221; His reinstatement took FSF&#8217;s staff by surprise, as they were not informed or consulted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mozilla, the Open Source Initiative, Red Hat, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and other prominent tech organizations also opposed the decision in published statements and removed their support for FSF and critical funding.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/\">The WordPress Foundation</a>, which previously listed FSF among the project’s inspirations, quietly removed the link from the website following the controversy. WordPress’ executive director Josepha Haden Chomphosy published a <a href=\"https://josepha.blog/2021/04/02/on-recent-news-about-the-fsf-board-of-directors/\">statement</a>, saying she did not support Stallman&#8217;s return as a board member, and confirmed to the Tavern that this is also the WordPress project’s official stance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In what appears to be an attempt to claw its way back to a semblance of accountability, FSF&#8217;s newly approved <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/about/board-of-directors-code-of-ethics\">Code of Ethics</a> is targeted at preempting future incidents of board members acting on behalf of the organization without permission. A few relevant ethics in the document include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Members of the board of directors will not undertake an activity that substantially hurts the FSF. When acting as board members, they will work toward the success of the FSF.</em></li><li><em>Board members shall all avoid placing&#8211;and the appearance of placing&#8211;one&#8217;s own self interest or any third-party interest, including the interests of associate members, above that of the organization as a whole.</em></li><li><em>Board members shall not speak on behalf of the FSF unless given explicit permission. Directors must not represent that their authority as board members extends any further than it actually extends. The board speaks as a whole, not as individuals.</em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>New governance is a positive step towards transparency and accountability, but after all the damage done during the botched rollout of Stallman&#8217;s reinstatement, it&#8217;s not likely that opposing organizations will settle for anything less than his removal from the board. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 21:45:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"Post Status: Post Status Excerpt (No. 37) — WordPress Community In Africa\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=89996\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://poststatus.com/excerpt/37/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3639:\"<h2>&#8220;You shouldn\'t be the one to always take, you want to be the one to always give.&#8221; —Mary Job</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In this episode of Post Status Excerpt, David chats with special guest <strong>Mary Job</strong>.

A <a href=\"https://github.com/youknowriad/kubrick2\">block-based version of the old-school Kubrick WordPress theme</a> exists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg lead Matías Ventura tweeted a quick video of it in action yesterday.

And, there is nothing that embodies that more than Kubrick, WordPress&#8217;s second default theme. It was literally named &#8220;Default&#8221; and represented the platform for over half a decade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even today, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/default/\">Kubrick/Default</a> still has over 10,000 active installs. I wonder whether it is running on now-defunct sites or if the number represents still-active bloggers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme was the face of WordPress during its rise to dominance as a CMS. Theme authors owe more credit to it than any others. It was copied, forked, repackaged, and redistributed more times than most of us will likely ever know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kubrick 2, as it is named in the GitHub repository, is still a work in progress. There are still a few kinks, such as single posts showing the excerpt instead of the full content. However, it is a working theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shocking thing about it is how little code it took to recreate Kubrick with the block system. The original theme, last updated in 2020 and now at version 1.7.2, falls short of 11 kb of CSS. I cannot remember the last time I saw a classic WordPress theme with so little code. The block-based version currently uses a handful of <code>theme.json</code> settings and has no CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it did not take me long to dive into the site editor and start customizing. The most recognizable design aspect of Kubrick was its gradient-blue header. It was also one of the pieces that users from around the blogging world would customize to make their site feel like their own. They would decorate it with custom colors, gradients, and even images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, with the block editor, that is far simpler than a decade and a half ago. Plus, there are more options.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n\n<p>With such power in my hands back in 2005, I am not sure if I would have pursued theme development at all. I probably could have done everything I needed to do within the WordPress admin. Kubrick was one of my first introductions to theme design, and I owe an unpayable debt to it. It is nice to know that its legacy continues to live on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For old time&#8217;s sake, I spent a few minutes making modifications via the site editor &#8212; ever so slightly modernizing it. However, I did not want to lose the flavor of the original work.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>I am as comfortable as anyone can be in the editor. I know most of its pain points, but this somehow felt more natural than usual. Maybe it was the simplicity of a theme from a bygone era. Perhaps the site editor and I were just seeing eye to eye today. Or, it might simply have been in the cards. I had a lot of fun venturing down memory lane.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I doubt Kubrick 2 sees a lot of action in the real world. Maybe a few folks who are as nostalgic as I am will install it when it is ready for production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like Ian Stewart did with <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2010/01/06/new-default-theme-wordpress-kirby/\">Kirby in 2010,</a> maybe some adventurous theme author will take it upon him or herself to build a modern-day successor to Kubrick.

I am one of the people at post status. Um, if you\'re not familiar, go to post status.com. It\'s a great community. In fact, they might as well be sponsoring this whole thing. What we do is we record, we do Twitter spaces every once in a while we record them and we make them available as podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, a few rules before we get started here, as we still get a few more people coming in, um, just we\'ll make it very simple, prove a code of conduct. Just pretend this is a work camp. Be nice. You try to be family friendly in terms of your language and your feedback and your comments. And be be advised that this is a public space and you will likely be recorded and used later in a podcast or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are listening on your mobile app, you have the opportunity to request, um, feedback. We would like to, uh, like to ask if you could limit your questions or feedback to at least 30 or 60 seconds at a time. Initially that [00:01:00] way we are only planning for maybe 30 minutes or so of discussion this evening may be a little bit longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we\'ll try to get to everyone. And I know people are still digesting what Matt spoke about tonight as well. I didn\'t get a chance to hear everything he said either. So we\'re hoping if we don\'t bring up some things that were covered. And if you feel like something was important that stood out into night\'s state of the word, then please feel free to bring it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re also watching the post status slack right now on the club channel. If you feel like typing rather than talk. So anyway, um, there is a distinction just once again, we had some confusion on this last month, you can listen to Twitter spaces on the desktop that does work, but you will not be able to raise your hand or talk as far as I know you need the mobile app for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you feel like you want to contribute, switch over to the mobile app. Okay. So we have with start off with our initial four, um, speakers for tonight. [00:02:00] Um, Eric, can you tell us just a few seconds of, can you unmute yourself first of all, Eric, and tell us, um, who you are in the WordPress space in 30 seconds or less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> I\'m Eric Karch, evac. I\'m a web designer and writer for specie boy.com. And I\'ve been using WordPress for well over a decade. And this is my 25th year in the industry overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Um, Ray, is this the F, is that your first? Am I doing that? Right? There was only three letters, but I feel like, okay. Where, where are you from right now in the world?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rae Morey:</strong> Um, I\'m based in Melbourne Australia. It\'s currently just after 11:00 AM here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I am so stinking jealous, but go ahead. What, what published, what publication are you from?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rae Morey:</strong> I published the repository. It\'s a weekly newsletter that, um, takes a bit of a deep dive into the news each week and, and kind of picks apart [00:03:00] with the headlines and what people are saying about&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> oh, excellent. We\'ll be look forward to hearing some of your comments. Um, Mr. Palomo Palomo whiskey. I think I butchered that like some fine beef.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, can you, uh, unmute yourself and tell us a few things about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maciek Palmowski:</strong> Yes, you did a bit. Uh and, uh, well of course, when you say it that fast, it sounds better, but go ahead. Yeah. Uh, yeah, you know, Polish is, is, is very hard. So English is hard for me, but yes, but if you\'re from another publication as well. Yes. Uh, I am from WP owls, uh, which let\'s say I do at night because, uh, during the day I am a hundred percent Basadur at body and, uh, w P owls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, we also try to find some interesting things that are happening in the WordPress space. Uh, we try to [00:04:00] focus a bit more on the things that happens for developers, but of course, we also find all the news and try to share everything with this interests. Hmm. Here at night. WPLS I S I see the connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> All right. Finally, that Hannon welcome to the program.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bet Hannon:</strong> Hi, David I\'m Ben and I live in central Oregon and the USA. I run an agency that designs and develops WordPress does manage hosting for WordPress. So we have a specialization with accessibility. So we do a lot of things with accessibility, and I\'m also a local meetup organism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So we, uh, we have a little bit of a diverse bunch here in terms of, at least we have at least an agency owner. We have a couple of people from the news we have, and there\'s a lot more interesting people that hopefully we\'ll get to meet in the audience as well. So Eric, why don\'t we start with you from maybe a developer perspective, but from any perspective, what\'s the biggest thing that jumped out at you that Matt talked about tonight?[00:05:00]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Well, first of all, I was glad that he, he kind of explained, uh, you know, the whole web series. Um, topic that, you know, we weren\'t quite sure what he was going to say on that. Uh, we weren\'t sure if maybe he was going to introduce NFTs to a WordPress somehow. Uh, so I was glad he kind of, um, spoke about how that already fits in with work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress, WordPress is already doing it. It is a decentralized platform. It is, um, you know, something that you own the content of your site. So I was really happy about that. And I think the other thing that really, um, interested me was when he was actually talking about his youth a little bit about his time building B2, um, those things kind of stood out to me because he started out much the same way I did no, you know, formal education and it just did it because he was passionate about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that\'s something we don\'t always hear from Matt. So I thought that was, um, [00:06:00] really great to hear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> He seemed to be a little more personable. I mean, I don\'t mean, I, you know, I guess I\'ll go next and a little bit in terms of what I thought overall. Um, we\'ll, I\'ll let you all handle the technical, but overall, maybe it was the smaller stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it was the fact that he hadn\'t spoken in front of people maybe in two years, I think he said, or maybe he, or at least in front of a WordPress crowd, he seemed to like be more happy or at least like a little bit more. And he seemed to be a little bit more, um, I don\'t know. I can\'t really put a word on it of personable or, um, maybe nervous too, maybe a little bit of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it could have been the most nervous. I\'ve seen Matt out of state of the word in a long time and maybe that was because of the proximity or because of COVID or whatever. Um,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bet Hannon:</strong> I think it\'s really different when you\'re speaking to a small. Based versus thousands, you know, thousands of people in a big auditorium, it just feels really different when you\'re in front of a small audience since we, you, since we have you bet, why [00:07:00] don\'t you tell us what, what\'s the one thing that probably stood out to you the most now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yeah. You know, it\'s actually a thing that kind of surfaces again and again for me, and it\'s a little bit of a push Paul. And so, uh, uh, on the one hand, I really celebrate all the ways that we are, um, making customization so much apart. And we\'re giving so much ability for people with little or no coding skills to be able to do these amazing things with their sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an agency owner, you know, I have clients who have, you know, five or 10 or 15 content creators, and they don\'t want to give that kind of, they don\'t want their content creators necessarily going off brand for example. And so there\'s, uh, I\'m always kind of trying to think about, uh, you know, balancing that out or, uh, thinking about how will we help our clients work with their content creators, amid [00:08:00] all of this amazing ability to customize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> As an, as an agency owner where you overall satisfied with what was presented tonight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bet Hannon:</strong> Oh yeah. You know, uh, it\'s always great to hear how things are going, looking. Uh, I thought it was really interesting the, um, the perspective that Matt was giving on some of the acquisitions, but it\'s a, it\'s not just happening in WordPress, that there\'s a much broader kind of, um, you know, that\'s happening at a much larger scale and all across many industries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, so yeah, no, I, I really was pleased.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So, um, our, our WP gals and our repository people here, they cover the news. They cover acquisitions as far as everything else. I\'ll let you decide which one of you wants to go first, but again, same question. What was the biggest thing that stood out to you during maths?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk the seat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rae Morey:</strong> I\'m happy to jump in. Um, I think, um, [00:09:00] one of the big things for me, I think, which you\'ve kind of already touched on is the energy of the address today. Um, it was very obvious that Matt was really happy just to be around like-minded people who, like he said, I got him dancing, a jig as an animator, which he also pointed out or your case, but it was really nice seeing him so happy he\'s been there and vocal about how uncomfortable he was last year during the prerecording.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it was nice to see him in front of a crowd again. Um, but I, I guess just the energy of seeing things moving forward again, after a bit of a, not a stagnant past couple of years, but things have been a bit slower with contributors being involved, I guess in WordPress has been, um, a bit of a slow down in number of people contributing to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, And I, he was feeding off the energy in the room, as bet said. Um, I guess one of the other takeaways for me was, um, just, uh, you know, uh, [00:10:00] we didn\'t know what he was going to talk about, um, around web three. And, and if T\'s, it was, uh, you know, there a bit of speculation around what he was going to say, few ideas floating around, but it was really nice to see or to hear him talk about, you know, basically WordPress is already leading the way when it comes to web three to centralization of the web and, and ownership over content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it was really nice for him to address that and, and talk about where WordPress fits into that space. Um, you know, as well as the focus on open verse and, um, you know, where that\'s going to go in, in 2022 is, is really exciting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Oh, and Mr. Owl, I feel like I need to ask you something about the Tootsie roll pop, but I don\'t think the kids today will get that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maciek Palmowski:</strong> So, um, for me, uh, there were two things that really stood out. First of all, uh, when he mentioned the number of, uh, people doing translations and the languages in the repository, uh, because [00:11:00] I am a non native English speaker, which probably you can hear with my thick accent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I think it\'s cool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maciek Palmowski:</strong> Thank you. Uh, but um, I know how many people in Poland, for example, need to see their CMS in, in Polish because English, it\'s not something they want to, they want to read some, some of my clients that I had don\'t even knew English or just didn\'t felt comfortable with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, the, the growing number of polyglots, this is really something great. And this is really a thing that, uh, Um, that will really make WordPress bigger and bigger. Uh, w when we confronted with, uh, other CMS is out there because most of them are still mostly created and maintained [00:12:00] in English. So this is something very important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there was one sentence that was also very intriguing for me. Maybe I, um, I misheard it, but I thought that Matt, at some point mentioned something about breaking a bit, uh, how he called it, that backward compatibility. Yeah, he did. I remember him talking about that, what specifically thinking of exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is, um, I know that he mentioned it, uh, in the, in the context of, uh, in the context of themes, maybe, maybe, and this is. A bigger step to some bigger changes in, in inside of core, inside of, uh, uh, of, of, uh, of the coal tooling and stuff like this. So, uh, really Matt saying, let\'s break the [00:13:00] backwards compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is something huge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Did he say that though? Break? I remember I may have missed that quote.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maciek Palmowski:</strong> You mentioned something. I mean, it wasn\'t, uh, as the size, if it\'s let\'s break that backwards compatibility, but in terms of WordPress, when we, I would say we have a bit paranoid, backward compatibility, which is great in some cases, um, Talking about breaking any backward compatibility is something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah. Matt did quote, this was a quote in this again, take, take in context and keep in mind that, you know, we\'ll listen to this again. And again, probably a few times to get a better understanding of what was said, but he did say in the presentation that a theme that was created with like an early version of WordPress, will it be like 1, 2 0 1, 5 or something like that would work with WordPress 5.9 next month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is what he said. And that\'s his, and that he said, quote, that\'s how serious we are about backwards compatibility. [00:14:00] Um, but like we said, that I would have to go back and listen, but I know, I know at least currently has strengthened backwards. Compatibility seemed pretty strong, at least from that statement now, whether or not it stays that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maciek Palmowski:</strong> Um, but I think it was a sentence before, when he mentioned that. The developers should move from the old editor to the new one. So we should update. So this is something, uh, but, uh, yes, I, like I said, I wasn\'t sure about this, but, uh, it caught my attention. So I think that, uh, yeah, I will have to relisten it once again to, to make sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So we\'ll let, we\'ll let that, uh, bet chime in here and then I\'m going to open before you start that. I\'m good. Then after you, I\'m going to open the floor a little bit of a few other people who are going to raise their hands and we\'re going to keep everyone on stage though. So you can keep interjecting back and forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re not kicking anybody off. I\'m sorry. Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bet Hannon:</strong> I might be wrong, but I think that Matt was referring to the breaking the backward compatibility in terms of the introduction of Gutenberg that the Gutenberg would break a [00:15:00] backward. That that would not be backward compatible as we move forward with blocks. Well, I might be wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Well, I don\'t know about you, but some of my old themes won\'t work with flux gear guaranteed. Yeah. And, and the old editor things in the old adage that use that tiny MCE editor are not going to work. And so there\'s some backward compatibility that is broken with the introduction of blocks. So, um, all right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, Jeff, welcome to the show. Welcome on stage. Um, Eric Ray, Brett, and Mr. Owl. I\'m going to refer to him as, um, are still on stage with us and are going to interact with anybody we bring up. Can you hear us, Jeff? Uh, absolutely I can. And Ray, you have an awesome accent. Thanks for that. She has, she\'s also in the morning too, so she\'s got that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perkiness that currently very few of us have right now, but oh, I have a coffee. So I\'m doing well, sorry. You\'re not making me [00:16:00] like you in any more, right. Uh, so Jeff, what for the, for us up here on stage and for the rest of the audience, what would you like to share about what you heard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Chandler:</strong> Um, I, you know, I think people on the, in a web three space might look at what Matt said on stage as him maybe Disney web three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think what he did was he cautiously tiptoed around the subject. He brought it up, he skimmed the surface. So I think at the very least people know that he\'s aware of it. He\'s going to keep his eye on it. And it may come up again in next year\'s state of the word, but I don\'t, I think you did a good job with bringing it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But one of the things I also enjoyed that he brought up, I\'m glad that he brought up was when he went over the market share numbers. And this is something that Yoast EVOC did in his CMS market analysis posts is that he talked about how software as a service company is Wix Squarespace. And, uh, some of the other ones they\'re all rapidly growing and all of the open source solutions minus WordPress are losing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was glad that he brought [00:17:00] that up and that\'s something that we should keep an eye on. Uh, here in the next few years,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> He also said something interesting too. About, and this was in a different part of the presentation, but regarding Drupal and Joomla, I got him quoted as saying he thought they would be more successful if they had apps, which I thought was interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Chandler:</strong> I, I thought, I thought they had the apps, but if they don\'t, I think that\'s a very valid point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah, that\'s true. So market share was definitely something that, that brought up 43%. And I won\'t go into it now because it\'s not relevant to the state of the word precisely, but wean very soon because of an Amazon shutting down, Alexa, we may not have the privilege or the opportunity to have percentage of market share numbers like we do today, so that, you know, examining this information now for Matt, I think during the state of the word is very important because without those are W3C texts, numbers are based on Alexa and Alexa is shutting down in, I think may of next year, Amazon shutting it down, not that Alexa, [00:18:00] the other Alexa, and I\'m just turned on a bunch of Alexis and people\'s houses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Chandler:</strong> And one of the last things I\'ll say here before I get off, is that I think it\'s obvious that 20, 22 is going to be the year of the open verse.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I, I can\'t, I, every time I think of open verse, I think of something else and I hate myself every time. I think of that associate, thank you very much, Jeff, for, for sharing with us, Scott.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, let\'s see. We\'re inviting Scott upstage or SKC. I think he likes to, I think that\'s his rap name.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scott Kingsley:</strong> Hey, what\'s up?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> What\'s up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scott Kingsley:</strong> Let\'s say Casey, you know me?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Oh God. He started her up already quickly before, before he does tell us what you thought of tonight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scott Kingsley:</strong> Uh, the&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>lack of banana milkshake representation, it was kind of a disappointment, but, and wanted to run that operation banana milkshake failed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> It was fine. Nobody knows what we\'re talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scott Kingsley:</strong> Oh, one out, but, uh, availed on asking the question. [00:19:00] So, cause he got up right near the end. I was like, oh, come on. You can get, you can get the question in there. But uh, I thought it was really interesting. Um, well obviously. I think web three is a whole thing, but I\'m really glad that he brought it more towards like reminding people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to remain cautiously optimistic about things and keep things open. Um, especially from the perspective of making sure things are, are done right. And you\'re not watching hucksters and stuff, but, um, but I think maybe the part I really liked the most was probably all around how, um, collaboration is phase three and we\'re, I know we\'re still a year out now, but, uh, if we could have gotten to that in 2022, I think that would have been a pretty big thing because there\'s so much about the collaboration idea of just like going into, um, uh, Figma or Google docs and you seeing everyone else were working together and, and just that collaboration aspect of things could make things so much easier, especially on the open web, we\'re trying to replace something like Google docs, [00:20:00] having an experience like that inside of WordPress and being able to collaborate like that would be pretty, pretty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah, I wish I knew more about it in terms of, um, he did say he was going to talk about web three and he did say NFTs in his blog post, but I don\'t think he said much about it unless I missed that part. I think he was just putting a bunch of keywords together. Um, yeah. Um, but he did make it a point to kind of bring up the larger issue about what those individual things stood for, at least from a philosophy philosophy standpoint, what you hear on the web in terms of, um, ownership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'m drawing a blank on the other things right now, but he did really kind of go into why WordPress was representing those things. And he did make a point that you can overlook some of the things that are the WordPress has four freedoms can be overlooked if you focus too much into some of the, I don\'t think he used the word hype, but I think he meant something like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So [00:21:00] there\'s a danger there overlooking what he thinks are the critical freedoms to WordPress. Eric, did you have.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah, I think he was also talking about decentralization a little bit with that. Um, just the basic idea that, you know, you can take your WordPress website with you to any host. Um, maybe it doesn\'t fit in exactly with like something like blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but it does kind of speak to, you know, the danger of going with, uh, you know, his favorite, uh, competitor Wix. I think he said that WordPress grew by two Weeks\'s over the last year, which was kind of a good line. Might have been my favorite of the night. I, I have a, I have a little chalkboard up here and every time he made a mark a comment about Wix, I drew a line and I\'ve got a couple of lines here on the board, but yes, he did make that comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Okay. I just going to say, I think that, that, um, you know, having that ability to move content from place to place is what\'s going to [00:22:00] separate. WordPress from everything else right now. I mean, as we see Joomla and Drupal dropping down well, WordPress is kind of like the last bastion of hope for open source at this moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe. I don\'t know, like see what other people think about that&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> You need to write a transformers movie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;That was excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Well, I, I think, you know, if, if, if that\'s the case, then you know, that\'s going to be the big selling point. Um, I actually had someone in my family wanted to start a blog this week and I pushed him to WordPress and not to Squarespace or Wix, because if you don\'t like the service, you\'re not going to be able to just take the website with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn\'t work that way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So let me let, speaking of that, um, let me ask a broader question. Cause I get a feeling we\'re going to boomerang back to the web three stuff anyway. Matt said, and this question goes for everybody on stage or anybody in the audience. Matt did say a quote later on in his, um, I think in his Q and a about, he said that, um, [00:23:00] 85% or some big percent of the web doesn\'t really care about it was either open source or owning your own content or something along those lines that most that WordPress would have in order to be usable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress would have to be a great user experience and WordPress will be invisible to those people. And that\'s okay. Does, what does anybody think about that? Do you agreed, or do you, do you think that number is larger or smaller or does that seem to gel with your philosophies and your observation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bet Hannon:</strong> That\'s true for a lot of people, they think they just, you know, uh, they just want to get the website up and they\'re really, uh, a little more platform agnostic. They want to know. Is it going to be hard? Right. They want to know about ease of use. They don\'t, but they don\'t really care that it\'s open source for not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Jeff, what do you [00:24:00] think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Chandler:</strong> Uh, I think for a lot of people that way, he said in terms of like maybe one or 2% of the people who understand TPO and its freedoms and what they mean, uh, those are the people, very, very small percentage of people. Uh, you know, it be an open source is not the concern. It\'s how to get the aid to be the fastest and the easiest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you, that pretty much explains why a Shopify and somebody software as a service solutions are growing a market share because they\'re providing a great user experience for a lot of people out there to get from a to B quickly and easily. So I think it was a nice for Matt to bring it up and saying, you know, if we\'re going to, uh, become the dominant player and get open for some more hands that even if it means that we\'re presses invisible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> That\'s okay. Yeah. I think that\'s reasonable. I think that\'s a little hard for some of us to like we accept on the surface, but I think some of us have to kind of dig down a little bit and realize that some of the things that we\'re passionate about us, not what 99% of most people passionate about. You know, they want something that works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ray Ray, uh, did [00:25:00] you have something to say, and then I\'m going to bring in a new speaker?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rae Morey:</strong> Yeah, no, I\'d absolutely agree if you\'re running a small business, you know, like my hairdresser, for example, she just built a website recently to support her new business and she\'s, um, using, um, GoDaddy, um, and they\'re, you know, website builder, and she built a site in an afternoon really easily with WordPress and, you know, people like that, they don\'t want to muck around with something that\'s really tricky to, to work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They, they wanna drop in their images or their content and have their website up and running with in her case. E-commerce as well, really quickly. And, um, you know, it\'s important. Um, platforms like, you know, it\'s not all about, um, WordPress being the center of attention in, in that space. It\'s, it\'s about elevating the user experience and making sure that users, um, can, um, have the tools they need to run their business without WordPress necessarily being front and center.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maciek Palmowski:</strong> And, um, [00:26:00] I wanted to mess one more thing because when the whole COVID madness started, many people realized that their business needs a website. Right. And you all remember that this was the moment. Uh, workers had a much bigger amount of downloads. WooCommerce was downloaded the biggest amount of, uh, of times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this was because first of all, workers was kind of popular. So people were able to find materials about how to insulate, how to create their first e-commerce. So they could, so their business could work during the pandemic. And it seems that WordPress was easy enough for them to just start to make their business round during those, uh, those hard times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And probably during the process, [00:27:00] they started to. More and more things, how to optimize some things. And some of them learned probably a finger to about, uh, about C, about search engine optimization about performance and stuff like this, but still, uh, we saw how many businesses started their websites on WordPress, because it was easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was free.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah. Free. In fact, a real Aruba hope. I probably butchered your name in the chat. She says, I think for a lot of folks open source means free in that vein for some folks, open source also means hard to install. And she says, when I pitched WP, I rarely talk about the open source aspect. I talk about the ease of use security, constant updates, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, playing to the strong, playing to the strong points there. If it\'s okay with you, Mr. Owl, I liked to switch over to Hazel. Who\'s been waiting patiently. Hopefully she\'s not mad at me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hazel Quimpo:</strong> Hi. I don\'t get mad. Um, [00:28:00] quick. No, I mean, I think I\'m on the same page with a lot of the folks is like, I don\'t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think of like travel agents, right? And I feel like we\'re at this stage where, you know, you used to go to a travel agent to get all your stuff. And I think if you have a really small website, you don\'t need to even go to like your cousin. Who\'s a WordPress developer. Well, you might need to today. But I think that the expectation is you shouldn\'t have to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I like from the lay person who doesn\'t know about WordPress, who doesn\'t know what, whatever they think they should be able to go and set up their website and frankly they can. And I think that\'s where we need to realize that\'s where the people, I was recently looking at tons of web hosts. And so many of them tout like image compression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And do you know how many people I know that start businesses every day, who care about image compression? Like zero to say a lot, but I guess I was way wrong</p>\n\n\n\n<p>for touting these things. Expect. And I think we need to realize some of that when we do WordPress stuff is like, cool. Like we do believe in the open source nature of the things we believe in [00:29:00] owning your content. But I view it a lot of the way. Like, you know, my doctor tells me to drink less and eat healthier, and I think that\'s a good idea, but I don\'t care that much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that\'s how the rest of the world is right. And Hazel, for as long as we have you in the living, as long as we have you in the living world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Thank you for, thank you for that. Um, I\'m gonna put, I\'m gonna put you back into the audience, but for the love of God, please don\'t disappear right away cause you\'re scaring me now. Um, stick around please in the world that we\'re living and in our, in our little chat room here, Dave, Ryan, um, you\'re onstage. Welcome to whatever we\'re calling this little freak show. How are you? Apparently Dave\'s a quiet person. That\'s fine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave:</strong> Sorry, Twitter space is cut out there for a second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> No problem. Real quick. Tell us what you thought of that. What, what stood out to you or what did you, or maybe you\'re responding to someone else\'s comment?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave:</strong> Well, I guess on the current topic, I think of WordPress. You know, if we look at [00:30:00] automobiles, there\'s a lot of different ways to get where you want to go, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But WordPress is ideally these sort of Toyota Camry, the undeniable, you know, lay person, car that anyone, you know, that almost just blends into the background, but is everywhere. And you live where I live with. But also, you know, like the Ford transit van, if we\'re looking at blue commerce, the thing that every business needs to get, where it needs to go and, you know, it can be customized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I guess the one thing that really stood out to me about the presentation today is just kind of the talk about the open verse photo directories, digital art, the project doesn\'t really have an apparatus today to do content moderation at scale. And I\'m not sure that that\'s something that volunteers could really easily be asked to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, once you create a way for people to easily express themselves, you also open up, you know, copyright [00:31:00] issues, uh, hate, um, questions about what\'s decent and what isn\'t, and you have to navigate a global web of legal frameworks or. So I think as excited as I am about those ideas, and I think it\'s a great opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also think that Twitter and Facebook have proven that money and AI don\'t necessarily solve those problems. And so I\'m just curious how the project that going forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> That\'s uh, I would, I would say that too, Adam attempted to ask that toy. He did ask it, um, or attempted to address that as well. And I\'m, I\'ll, I\'ll be honest with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t know much about now there was a distinction between the open verse project and the, what was the other thing? Was the WordPress photo project or photo library? Something, um, I\'ll admit. I admit I, I\'m not really good in depth on both of those, by the way. Did I mention, I worked for post tennis? Um, But I, yeah, so there was definitely talk of like, if you uploaded a [00:32:00] photo somewhere with that data, some of the data that sticks to it, you know, like how you upload a photo, like if you upload a photo to Twitter, for example, from your phone on your phone, there\'s metadata attached to that photo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you upload it to Twitter, it\'s gone. Um, but that\'s just, that\'s just one level. And what you\'re talking about is the, what hits the news a lot, like in terms of, you know, you could be posting photos without people\'s permission, or you could be posting hate speech or that sort of thing. So, and we all know that\'s a moderation nightmare, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Guest:</strong> I think today, the ways that we contribute to WordPress have a steep enough curve and our barrier to entry that we don\'t deal with as much of that. But I think the big question is going forward as we make it radically easier to contribute, how are we going to tackle the problem that all these other networks have had to deal with once they scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> That\'s an excellent question. I feel like I\'m still at the Q and a part of State of the Word. I really, yeah. Subtly we should, [00:33:00] we should get that question in front of Matt and some other, some other people\'s. So I think that\'s an excellent question. Dale has decided they don\'t have a really good answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A thought about that. Thank you though, for, for speaking up. Um, so one of the other things that was spoken about here, and I get a feeling this was in, in an inescapable gravitational force in 2021 was acquisitions. And we mentioned this briefly. Um, do you agree, does the, is there anybody here that maybe sees Matt\'s point, but has a different opinion in terms of this is I think it\'s, I think the point he was getting across was this is happening everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s not just in the WordPress space. Is that, is that generally something that you would agree to? Um, the way he presented it, especially with lots of nice old charts. Does anybody have an opinion on his take on acquisitions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if I can take a silence as a yes. If anybody wants to, [00:34:00] I, I can, uh, chime in, I guess.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Chandler:</strong> Um, I think one of the things he mentioned, he mentioned Yost by name, and I think he also talked about, you know, the number of employees and what they\'re doing and kind of extrapolating the impact that, that accompany like that has like all the millions and millions of websites that are like, just for example, running Yoast right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I think he\'s what he\'s kind of getting at is that there\'s a lot of responsibility in that. And for a lot of smaller entrepreneurs who started out with these plugins. You know, maybe that\'s just getting to be to a point where they\'re just not able to do it anymore. I know that was part of the, the case with advanced custom fields from they, they were sold, um, you know, it was a one man operation with a user base in the millions and, you know, kind of how do [00:35:00] you, how do you manage that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you continue to, to support it and build the product at that scale? When, you know, you\'re just a small group of people or even just an individual. Um, so it\'s, it\'s a matter of WordPress is growing so radically big and you can\'t be a one person team, especially on something that large sure. Seems like it these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I I\'m, I don\'t doubt that, you know, individuals are still gonna come up with amazing things, but to compete at the level of a Yoast or an AC. I don\'t know how that\'s sustainable for a long period for such a small group of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Well, I think that also, and not to get off track here because this isn\'t, I think Matt didn\'t mention this at some point directly cause he ma he brought up the CD comic about, um, about it there\'s I tweeted [00:36:00] it, but I\'m looking, I\'m trying to look at the picture right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s basically about picture a all modern digital infrastructure being a giant castle. And there\'s this one little piece of the bottom that says a random, some random person in Nebraska, thankfully maintaining a project since 2003. Um, that, that is kind of also the same problem, in my opinion, in terms of like, it is this, there is a strength of open source and yet there\'s this weakness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think this week two, if anybody\'s been following the news about the Java exploit that came out on Friday, who\'s named now, I\'m not remembering logs. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Guest:</strong> log4j</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> yes, that\'s, that\'s it. So we\'re beginning to see these things happening outside of WordPress and open source that we\'ve been kind of contemplating now for quite some time, whether it\'s bugs, whether it\'s something that needs to be addressed in terms of open source manpower, or woman power human power, or it\'s a, like you said, Eric, it\'s an acquisition thing you absorb, somebody gets [00:37:00] acquired because they can\'t physically maintain it on the same scale anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, did that did accurately that I accurately represent you there? Eric didn\'t mean to?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Oh yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Okay, great. I\'ve got uh, oh, Ooh. We\'ve got an entire company on the line right now. It\'s Pagely so this, this should be interesting. Pagely uh, who specifically inside page?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave from Pagely:</strong> It\'s Dave struggle as I\'m probably having dinner right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Bless his heart. Go ahead, sir.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dave from Pagely:</strong> Well, it\'s great to see us on the big board with the acquisitions. It\'s been quite a month for us. We\'ve been part of GoDaddy now for a little over four weeks, and I want to dovetail something that was said earlier, which I tweeted a Jeffer a second ago. Um, we should be concerned about closed source platforms gaining in popularity, um, because none of us want to see the depth of the open web, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\'s great to see or press with the market share that it has. And you know, when everyone kind of says we need to get online, what\'s the first thing I think of is usually [00:38:00] WordPress, which is great. Um, Well, we\'ve been brought in to build with GoDaddy is this next generation of, of an open source commerce product on top of WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that gets us excited because that is open source. That\'s going to be built upon this platform and not, you know, going the way of, you know, Wix or Squarespace or any of that. So, you know, we\'re, we\'re still kind of committed to that, making sure everything is open source and that the open web doesn\'t go away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Hmm. Okay. Well, send a thank you very much and thank you for being a recognizable P avatars. I could quickly point around right here. Thank you. I mean, oh, sorry. Sorry. Going through a tunnel, going through a tunnel right now. Sorry, I can\'t hear you. No, we\'ll, we\'ll keep you on. We\'ll keep you on the stage a little longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Ryan, welcome to the party. Do you, did you have a comment for the group, Ryan? I [00:39:00] think that\'s Ryan mark. It is. Yes. Okay. Ryan, welcome. Welcome to the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ryan Marks:</strong> Oh, well, thanks. Uh, the, the graphic that you were talking about and the person in Nebraska reminded me of the recent news with the PHP foundation and the fact that there was a bus factor of two, uh, with respect to how many people actually knew the code base, according to articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, I just thought that was somewhat similar, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So, yeah, so I\'m, so this was all coming to the original, um, me bringing up the acquisitions part of it. And some of it is the acquisitions that especially, I think it absorbed the one or two people. The small companies are, are probably doing WordPress a favor in some regards in the long run, because otherwise, like you get hit by a bus, what happens to advanced custom fields, which a lot of people rely on, uh, I think Matt presented that pretty well in terms [00:40:00] of, um, the numbers and some people, some people have different opinions about what is happening in the WordPress space, but there is some validation or some validity of taking a step back and looking at the largest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was one bar graph and I\'ll be honest with you. I\'m not really that business oriented again. I work at post status. Thank you very much that on 2021, a bar graph just like shot the way the heck up. I think it was the, um, think it was, it was, it was something about the money that was, that was being transferred at hand-to-hand or something along those lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it\'s just 20, 21 just basically exploded for the rest of the tech industry. And WordPress is a part of that tech industry. So it\'s not just WordPress and, but at the same time, I think WordPress has its own valid reasons for why it\'s happening. There were 42 logos on Matt\'s slide. At one point we have a WordPress acquisition tracker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I posted a sock hops last acquisition. So I\'ll have to go back later and see if all those logos are. Otherwise, I\'m not doing my job. Um, what [00:41:00] else did we, oh, bet. Did you have a common rule?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bet Hannon:</strong> Well, I was just gonna say, I think some of the acquisitions or, you know, the pandemic really caused people to just stop and think a lot more about quality of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, you know, I think sometimes you stop and you take a look around and you say, I think I want to move on and do some other things, or I think I\'ve done what I can do here for now. And so some of that can be there. And so I think in 2021, you know, that that\'s a piece of more, more broadly. A lot of those acquisitions happening is just people thinking differently about what they want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> There was a good comment made on another podcast of there was, um, if you look at the big tech, big tech companies, now that started maybe 10 years ago, um, Amazon\'s founder is no longer with the company he\'s off on rocket ships or something. Um, there\'s the, the original founders of Microsoft are long, no longer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The founders of Google are no longer there. Apple\'s obviously [00:42:00] had new leadership. The only person I think running the same ship they have for awhile has been mark Zuckerberg at Facebook. So all of these people have moved on after a certain period of time and they\'ve done it all within a relatively short period of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think Twitter has been the latest one where Jack Dorsey just basically stepped completely away and he\'s off following his next adventure. Other people have just basically retired. So it\'s not just about the money in the, in the, in the acquisitions, but it sounds like to me, people, you know, you can, if you, if you\'re really successful, you have the opportunity after 5, 6, 7, 8 years to say, maybe I want to do something different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe. All right. Um, Jeff, can you, what do you, what are your thoughts?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Chandler:</strong> I, in and talking about the acquisitions for a little bit, there is kind of like two separate topics for getting conflated with each other, between the five for the future and an acquisition. I dunno, I was getting little confused, but I think [00:43:00] the whole fight for the future initiative, I think is going to take on even more important as we go forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we look at open source maintainers and the bus factor of two and open source is seen as something that\'s free, but there\'s people behind it. There were people putting in time and work and effort and the passion, and it can only go so far and somebody is going to have to flip the bill. And I\'m looking forward to ma maybe putting like an executive director or somebody in charge of the five for the future initiative and get that out into the public\'s eye more often because outside of web dev studios, uh, advertising what they\'re doing and how they\'re contributing, and then some efforts from GoDaddy and 10 up, I mean, it\'s kind of like a behind the scenes thing, and I\'d like to see more effort on making the whole fight for the future thing, uh, initiative, go more public, get more people involved and get more people to know about, especially companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Oh, okay. Sounds good. Sorry, [00:44:00] Jeff. A bucket, a bucket of chicken wings just went by my field of view and I got distracted for a second. Courtney, um, Robertson, let me add you as a speaker here. Um, after this, I want to talk about the next generation of WordPress users, which was part of the Q and a at the end there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and what we might think might be our thoughts on bringing in, or people attracted to WordPress for the first time, especially the next generation, but Courtney, what do you got for us?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Hey there. So, um, one, we saw Andrea and Middleton lurking in the crowd, and I just have to say, I am so glad to see your face popping up and we all miss you as we\'re talking about five for the future,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> let\'s do a show just about her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that would drive her. I think that she would love it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> I think so. So did anybody else notice piggybacking off of what Jeff just said, but the very last thing that Andrea wrote to the WordPress community, aside from a fantastic series of posts on her own site, you [00:45:00] head over, if you head over to make.wordpress.org/project suggested iterations for the five for the future program and the tool, um, and ways that we can perhaps reinvision what five for the future could look like from this point, moving forward, how to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do a fantastic job at connecting the five for the future initiative, with the various teams. Um, there are things in Andrea\'s post on the project about the pledges to the different teams and ways to get more connected, partnering up the talents of those that are able to contribute with five for the future, with those in the teams that need to have stuff happen to get work done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I wanna say that I participated in a number. I want to say five probably contributor days over the past year on behalf of the training team, all of these being virtual summit attached to a word camp, [00:46:00] some as part of the translator day, which was really a month and a few other kinds of things. Yoast did a fantastic job at partnering the various folks with different sets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And reaching out to the various make teams and saying, w we have this day coming up, we\'re going to break into, um, a hybrid partially online, partially in person break into different groups and get to work on different things. What are some of the tasks that we can look at? I think when we look at five for the future, um, you know, my employer go, daddy has been amazing at helping fund through five for the future fund.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the word camp events that we see happen, um, sponsoring some other great places like post status and other things, too. But as we\'re, as we\'re looking to the future, I really am excited around doing contributor days through post status, inviting all folks that are in [00:47:00] post status and the wider community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get connected and similar to how Yost has done it. And perhaps in conjunction with Yoast, we\'ll see in the very near future. Um, but connecting with the various team reps and connecting with the teams that have needs and saying, let\'s match up these skill sets of the talent that we\'ve got in our company and the things that need to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also simultaneously open that thing up by calling in the wider WordPress community, because across the teams, teams are really hurting during COVID not only can we seen the attendance of things like bird camps and all of the setback, uh, you know, a number of years comparatively in the stats, but across the teams were hurting to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors that are showing up to actually do some of the work on the teams. And there\'s a lot of talent and a lot of interest in what\'s going on. So, um, I just, I love the posts that Andrea left us with. I love that Andrea is in the room right now. I loved the, [00:48:00] we could do a five for the future contributor day series through post status.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So quarterly ones that will probably be hybrid. I welcome anyone that would like to help organize something like that, um, to connect with me over in post status. Oh, well, thank you very much. And, um, I\'m sure Andrea is very honored. Um, I\'ll speak for her a little bit here. Um, yeah, so obviously I\'m a little bit biased.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Cause my daughter was mentioned. I don\'t think she\'ll be in the witness protection program anytime soon. Thanks to tonight. But she was absolutely absolutely thrilled, but she\'s not like, but I don\'t. I want her to be more like blending into a larger crowd of younger people that are running their own hackathons or they\'re doing their own thing within the comforts of, you know, being even mildly associated with the pro WordPress community. Even if they\'re not sitting down to crew to quote unquote directly contribute. Um, um, Amir, I think, do we have you [00:49:00] back on now? Can you say something, let us know that you\'re still alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We might be having some difficulties, maybe your Mike\'s not on or something. I try and again here. Um, yep. Oh, you\'re muting yourself on and off. Are you, is it Morris code? I see a blinking. Nope. All right. I\'m going to leave you on speaker for a second and then I\'ll let Ryan cut into here, Ryan</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ryan Marks:</strong> . Um, so I had a question for those that do pledge five for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you feel that you do it primarily with people man hours, or do you do it with dollars or is it a mix? Do you feel like you actually get the 5%, if anything, or is it more, we try to get something close. I think that has her hand, right? So we do fight for the future. Um, I don\'t know that we calculate it, but you know, certainly, um, you know, [00:50:00] I contribute my time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bet Hannon:</strong> Um, and then our, our agency subsidizes our people as they, you know, they can, they can put in, uh, you know, time that they\'re doing community work and get, um, get paid for that. Um, as a way that we try to support the wider community, I think that\'s just a part of, you know, my wife is an economist, so I understand that tragedy, the commons, uh, example really well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I want to make sure that the ecosystem stays supported. And so that\'s, that\'s a really, you don\'t have to be really big to do those things right. To, um, to, to make a difference. Uh, but I just feel like that\'s an important part of what we do is for the community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> All right. So as we start to run down here, cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did promise, uh, it promise someone I would be home in time for bed. I do. I want lot of stall all us to think about a maybe if, if there\'s any final comments you had about what Matt talked about or Matt\'s comments about uni questions or about how that [00:51:00] fits in with your version of WordPress in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you\'re thinking about that, let me quickly get, um, Olivia on. I think she wanted to make a quick comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re muted. Olivia,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>maybe we have a maximum number here. Maybe it\'s why this isn\'t working. Let me remove a speaker.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Olivia Bisset:</strong> I can speak</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Sorry, go ahead. What\'s your comment listener.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Olivia Bisset:</strong> Okay. So with five for the future, I don\'t know what, but it just got the general vibe that that\'s starting to head towards, like, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we got people now, but like youth, I feel like there was more of a youth focus. This state is a word, especially with the question from Allie and others. I don\'t know. That\'s my 2 cents.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I thought Allie gave an excellent question and [00:52:00] that was followed up by others as well. Um, and we\'ll have to go back and review that because my memory is beginning to fade a little bit, but I thought she had a very excellent question about what Matt thought the youth, um, what his advice to you would be regarding how to use WordPress for the next generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, let\'s um, let\'s take one more comment from the audience here and then we\'ll see if we go around. Anybody has any final thoughts, Aaron Edwards, um, welcome to whatever we\'re calling this. What, what do you have to share?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aaron Edwards:</strong> Uh, hi, I\'m the co-founder of web three WP. So of course we are very interested in what Matt had to say about web three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought it was a good kind of balance, like opinion, like, like Jeff Rose said, um, just the fact comparing WordPress to kind of some of the ideals, uh, web three, I think that was kind of a good tact that he took, but it was interesting just discussing in our community. It\'s like, it does follow like those ideals of data [00:53:00] ownership when you\'re the site owner, but it doesn\'t really address the site users, which is something that web three is kind of known for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It basically allows you, WordPress allows you to create your own data silo, you know, to maybe compete with the Facebooks or whatever centralized apps there are, but it doesn\'t necessarily empower users to continue to have your site on their own data. So that\'s kind of a interesting take that I heard in our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Interesting take at that sounded like I haven\'t heard that take exactly like that before. Uh, well, I kind of wrote that same thing on our website, but, oh, would you mind sending a link to that in post at a slack or wherever your finest links are sold?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aaron Edwards:</strong> Yeah. The web three wp.com pages talking about WordPress being, um, kind of along those ideals, but definitely it was, it was interesting to, to hear his take in that, uh, another thing he kind of made a joke about dowels and [00:54:00] domains, um, which kind of seemed like disingenuous to me personally, because I\'ve had experiences where I\'ve had domain registrars, uh, shut down my domain because someone filed a false abuse report, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\'s like that\'s renting. That\'s not really owning. As he kind of made it out to be okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I can see that point. Absolutely. And hopefully I won\'t have anything shut down on my side Verde, but thanks. Thanks for sharing and feel free to ping me in post status or on Twitter. I\'d like to get that link from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So, um, it\'s been about an hour. Um, so I wanted to, um, I did make, uh, wanted to see if anybody else has any last comments. Um, either somebody who hasn\'t spoken yet are part of our, um, ongoing panels here, um, that I know you wanted to share. Something felt like a last lot quickly with us, and then I\'ll nail a few other people that didn\'t sound right in my head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But go ahead and you under, do you [00:55:00] please take it, please take the mic from me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bet Hannon:</strong> Yes. Um, so I\'m a little disappointed that Matt didn\'t say more about accessibility. And the times when he talked about accessibility, he really meant it in the terms of just making things available to people, uh, like features available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but you know, we didn\'t talk about web accessibility and we we\'ve had some issues with that. Um, in the past, things are better than they were, but we still have a long way to go for web accessibility, especially in the WP admin side, in the dash, in the backend side. So Amber Heinz tried to call out Matt earlier in the week, uh, just to try and get him to speak a little bit more about accessibility, but he didn\'t so well, his slides were probably already written by then too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I don\'t, I\'m not going to speak for them&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They said they were editing them&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bet Hannon:</strong> up to the last minute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I know what that\'s probably true too. I can\'t speak to that, but no, he did mention it, but I\'m getting a feeling that for some people who wanted him to mention accessibility of may not have filled their cup to. [00:56:00] It\'s an important piece and growing in importance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bet Hannon:</strong> And so we have to pay attention to it if we want to keep that market term. Yes. Because like he said, we\'re pressed should be like, for most of the people, WordPress will be invisible. Right. If the, if the user experience is done. Right. And would you bet, um, I know you\'ve said many times that part of the user experience is what, well, it\'s gotta be accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. And it\'s gotta be, um, and as we\'re increasingly in the us having some, um, legal pieces where people are going to be required to have their sites accessible, we we\'re gonna need to be ready for that. Um, so we can help people do that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> All right. Um, speaking of Amber, I think we said her name three times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She\'s appeared. Um, we\'ll get right before we get to Ryan. Um, Amber, did you want to share something with us? I\'m guessing you want to share something that starts with the letter a and it\'s not your first name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amber:</strong> Uh, not Amber, uh, accessibility. Yeah, I think, I think the thing that\'s interesting too, I [00:57:00] actually got a couple of messages from, um, some users after they read, you know, the thread and conversations and in process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think maybe the contribution to core accessibility, the people on the accessibility team, particularly maybe some people that have disabilities that are part of the accessibility team. Probably I think there are some of them that feel like it\'s still not as positive or as central of a focus as it as maybe Matt kind of thinks that it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I think it still is a lot of an afterthought and really that\'s, you know, one of my hopes that I\'m really would love to see more. Thinking about accessibility as something you do at the beginning, not something that you do wait around at the end of the process, whether it\'s in core or whether it is, you know, in plugins or themes or on the front end of the end websites, [00:58:00] let\'s start at the beginning, not in the middle of the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> It\'s like how I should do most things in my life, especially the chores around the house. Thank you, Emery. We did see a lot of this stuff in accessibility mentioned in post status too. So we\'ve been following that as well. And thanks for speaking up here today. Really appreciate it. Okay. Let\'s let\'s go through the rest here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re going to be ending shortly, but Ryan, you are up next. Um, what closing remarks do you have for us?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ryan Marks:</strong> So three things caught my attention. Uh, and then I\'ll hang up and let you guys talk about, we\'ll just pretend you\'re not here. I can remove you as a speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> You don\'t have to hang up, but we can ignore you easily, but go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ryan Marks:</strong> Um, I thought that there was an open invitation for up to 50 people. So I tend to stand in the word, but then later it seemed like there were about 30 people there, there were all five for the future. And I thought that was just, that was an interesting change. Maybe a two, I thought the idea of a query block was something new and I liked it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:59:00] And there was a lot of focus on multi-lingual at the beginning and towards the end. And I\'m really interested to see how that will pan out. Me too. I don\'t think Matt was in it. It seemed like Matt wasn\'t in a position to quote a lot about phase four and rightly so, because not even phase three is happening next year officially, but I think we\'re, can\'t be aware of me maybe a little strange, a little bit more out of them, but I\'m looking forward to the language aspect as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> In fact, I\'m kind of surprised I was at the phase four at the four phases when he first announced it a couple of years ago. Um, Um, let\'s see who, uh, who else we got here? I think we have, um, let\'s see. I think we, Eric, I think it\'s down to you now. Um, you might, you might be closing here. I know no big pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> For baseball fans during this lockout, I\'ll try to be the closer here. Get on the mound and pitches to a victory here,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> not a sports person, but tackle, go and tackle and hit a fuel. Go right through the goalposts for me, please.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Okay. I\'ll shoot it into the [01:00:00] net for you. All right. So my bedroom aside, I think one thing I\'m interested to watch is the, um, the growth of block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt talked about, you know, hoping to have 3000 available, uh, at the next state of the word. That\'s going to be interesting because. I haven\'t seen like the commercial theme market takeoff for that yet. Um, there\'s a few opportunities there. I\'m seeing some, you know, some new ones come out. So it\'ll be very interesting to see in 2022, how much, uh, adoption rate there is for block themes and full site editing and what number of themes we actually get to buy the next state of the word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> What do you think? What\'s your guess?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> I\'m going to say somewhere around a thousand, that\'ll just be my completely uneducated guests. I think there\'s so many theme authors that are still kind of hanging to the classic theme, uh, you know, style and way of [01:01:00] building. Um, and it\'s probably going to be a little bit slower adoption than maybe Matt hopes, but, uh, you know, I may be very wrong on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Do you think it has to do with just being, not familiar and trying to stick with what works as long as possible?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> I think so. I think it\'s. If you watch how this is unfolding, it changes like almost weekly. And if I\'m a theme developer, I\'m probably going to hold off until I have a pretty good idea of what\'s going to be required and how these themes are going to work over the long-term before I invest a bunch of time in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think we\'re going to get there, but it may just take a little bit of time for people to get used to the idea and for standards to form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Hmm. That sounds reasonable. That\'s okay. I don\'t know. Or it could be something I just drank. That\'s making me agreeable to everything I\'d already said right now. It\'s possible. Well, anyway, I [01:02:00] really want to thank everybody who I think by the way, that was excellently, put Eric in terms of I could have been, that was just probably. 3000 sounds like an ambitious number. Who knows if we\'ll get there, but, uh, I think I\'ll put you down for a thousand and then this time, next year we\'ll come around and we\'ll see if we can collect on that bet and see if you were high or low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So appreciate it. Oh, wait. What\'s uh, let\'s get Jeff here is the real closer about you or the fake closer Eric. Let\'s let\'s not to put any pressure on you there, but Jeff, can you, can you close this out for us here? Oh, wait, whoa, sorry, Jeff. I think I just,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>okay. Jeff. Now you can go,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Chandler:</strong> uh, yeah, three words, block theme generator,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> block theme generator. Oh, isn\'t somebody working on that or is that somebody is already working on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Chandler:</strong> There\'s going to be more of [01:03:00] those created throughout next year. And 3000 I think is easily doable and there\'s going to be a bunch of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bunch of themes created from these generators. That\'s my take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So we\'re thinking, we\'re thinking the themes did themes really take off after the underscore S generator or a discourse came about? Is that, is that where you\'re considering more or less the equal the, was it underscore?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Chandler:</strong> Uh, I don\'t underscore is just like a starter theme, but you know, what, what I\'m seeing from the theme.json theme by theme generators nowadays seems to be just makes the theme generation process so much easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, if you\'re, if you\'re a theme developer and you\'re not excited about what\'s coming down the pike in 2022, what is wrong with you?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Well, wow. I mean, people ask what\'s wrong with me and I, they don\'t literally have the, I don\'t have the time to tell them all day. Um, okay, well, good. Yeah. So generator, we\'ll put that down as something for 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jason, did you have something to share before [01:04:00] we close out here or did I accidentally pushed the wrong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> No, you didn\'t accidentally push the wrong button. Hi everyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Hi Jason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> Hello. Well, there was a lot to, uh, digest and, um, the state of the word think it was interesting. Um, one of the things that we started noticing, uh, during our, our live broadcast of, of it was the fact that it\'s really interesting to, to have Matt interact with a smaller group of people versus such a larger room of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were also very disappointed that there was no boot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Well, I mean, where did it fit in the room? And that would, would\'ve been a lot of polishing dude to remove any, I don\'t know. I feel like I would have to be like the Adrian monk on that show where he just, you just basically have to hand wipe the entire thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn\'t seem so clean. Now after the last two years to be coming out of a boot, I mean, it was questionable to begin with. [01:05:00] Yeah, indeed. But yes, but yes, I, I think all of us are walking away here that this had a different, definitely that a different vibe. And I don\'t think it was just because we have, it\'s been two years since we\'ve seen Matt in front of a live studio audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it was the size of the event. I think the mood was a lot lighter. Um, and there was a lot, not just because of the less people in the room. I think Matt\'s attitude and his casualness were a little bit more open, a little bit more different directed, but it was still very good. So I, I agree with Jason that I think it had a lot to do with the environment on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we got to see me be a little bit more open Frank. Um, I dare say even some of it was even not that even rehearsed, not saying less rehearse, but I think maybe he, this is a couple of times tonight. He did pause for a while before answering a question, usually math pretty quick, usually mats pretty quick with questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he\'s always been a talented speaker in that regard. Something I\'ll never learn even after doing so many of these things with you people, but, but yeah, it really did see him [01:06:00] when seeing him pause and consider the questions, especially I think from Allie\'s question to really. It did mean a lot more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I kind of enjoyed what tonight brought even though I think next time in, by if this happens at the end of 2022 and it\'s in front of a larger audience, I don\'t think I\'d mind that either, but yes. Thanks. Thank you very much for having me. I appreciate it. No problem. No problem at all. Okay. I think that just about, does it this time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I promise. I want to thank everyone for joining us this evening, especially on the east coast and in where the time zones are and where the time zones, where you\'re very late. Mr. Owl. Um, I just want to say thank you very much for your, um, it\'s. What is it like one in the morning over there? I, I can\'t imagine what.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putting into your body right now to just doing the morning two in the morning. Oh my goodness. Oh, well, we admire your dedication, sir. Thank you for coming here and we hope to have you back soon. Uh, really, really appreciate it, Ray. Uh, on the other hand, you are bright and [01:07:00] cheery with your coffee in the morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, uh, damn you my dear, but I want to thank you for coming as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She\'s not speaking to</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bet Hannon:</strong> thanks so much for inviting me to be part of this chat David.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> No problem. We want you back more for some of you, the more insights that you have, um, examining the entire WordPress through the repository or that\'s something that\'s in my inbox and I read it first. Every, every chance I get I\'m going to drop in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it\'s Friday my time. I don\'t know. Time\'s a flat circle for me, but thanks for coming. Bet. Thank you for coming as well. Greatly. Appreciate you taking some viewpoints from an agency standpoint and accessibility. Thanks for coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hazel Quimpo:</strong> Great. Thanks for having me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Eric. Thanks for okay, now we\'re even now you don\'t owe me anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Hey, my pleasure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> And I want to thank, um, LemonadeCode, who is the cohost right now. Um, she has been my producer, my, my wing person. I want to thank her as well for her help this evening as well, making sure the equipment has been organized, pointing out when people were raising [01:08:00] their hands and criticizing me when I\'ve made very, very poor means on the web tonight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I want to thank you as well, Olivia. Thank you very much. Um, we\'re going to, this will be recorded and posted on post status in, in a day or two. So you can feel free to check out post status.com or our podcast links for that. And if you have any questions about anything we\'ve shared here, you want a copy of the recording, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ll feel free to share it with you.

I got off the elevator and was immediately greeted by Josepha and then Matt. It was SO GOOD to see so many friends and well-known WordPress faces!<br /><br />I took a reserved place in the front row and sat captivated by the environment, the information, and the nervous energy in the room. We were returning to some level of normalcy by being in that space together, and it felt both familiar and foreign after the last two years…but it was good.<br /><br />When the address was done, and all the questions had been answered, and the broadcast had ended, there was an elegant reception with food and beverages. I met new people and enjoyed the conversation.<br /><br />Not to be one to miss an opportunity, I asked Matt for an interview for Post Status, and recorded a 7+ minute conversation with him on the recent surge of acquisitions and the future of work in WordPress, that we will share later. He was truly gracious with his time, and I appreciated that very much.<br /><br />On leaving, I gathered my jacket and was handed a swag bag.<br /><br />All in all, I felt a bit like Cinderella, with a <strong>Lyft</strong> for a pumpkin carriage, purple hair as my tiara, and scads of friends helping me navigate the time with my electric scooter.<br /><br />I enjoyed every minute.<br /><br /><strong>Bonus:</strong> Michelle caught Matt for <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/matt-on-mergers-and-acquisitions/\">a brief interview</a> after the SOTW address!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/anna-square.png\" alt=\"Anna Maria Radu\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-background-color has-background\"><strong>Anna Maria Radu:</strong> I was happy to learn about <strong>Openverse</strong> as a visual storytelling fan myself. The fact that <strong>Creative Commons</strong> has become part of WordPress is probably one of the best things that could happen for creators. Their work can now be even more easily incorporated and credited within anyone\'s storytelling. By doing this we, as a community, are supporting artists to gain recognition and appreciation through WordPress. Open Content for the win!<br /><br />But probably the topic that stood out to me the most was the <strong>Diverse Speaker Program</strong>. I have worn many hats behind the scenes of pre-pandemic <strong>WordCamp</strong> events and WordPress-themed events in general. I loved seeing so much diversity — yet, there’s no such thing as too much diversity. I immediately joined the <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C028SE81N3H/p1638474295050100\"><code>#diverse-speaker-support</code></a> channel on <strong>WordPress Slack</strong> to learn more about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ajmorris-footer-profile.jpg\" alt=\"AJ Morris\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\"><strong>AJ Morris: </strong>I\'m excited for the future of block patterns and global styles! Having the native ability to use core block editor options for themes is going to <em>drastically</em> change the way we look at WordPress themes over the next 5 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CourtneyRobertson-square.jpeg\" alt=\"Courtney Robertson\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-background-color has-background\"><strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Matt\'s vision of what <em>contribution</em> could look like was really exciting. As a <strong>Make WP Training Team</strong> co-rep, I eagerly welcome more contribution efforts across the WordPress project by connecting with teams. See&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://poststatus.com/five-ways-to-participate-in-five-for-the-future/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Five Ways to Participate in <strong>Five for the Future</strong></a> for examples of how you can get involved as a contributor.<br /><br />Also, <strong>Michelle Frechette\'</strong>s and <strong>Allie Nimmons</strong>&#8216; questions for Matt after his presentation — about introducing WordPress to youth and young adults — really reminded me of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://courtneyr.dev/2021/08/09/teach-wordpress-by-sharing-what-you-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">why I teach WordPress</a>. I\'ve instructed high school students as WP developers, and there are logistical challenges. I\'d love to partner more closely with more educational organizations to help resolve these challenges. We can improve content across&nbsp;<a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress.org</a>&nbsp;as we become compatible with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2021/01/03/protecting-childrens-privacy-on-wordpress-through-the-lens-of-coppa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">COPPA requirements</a>.&nbsp; <strong>Sandy Edwards</strong>, <strong>Youth Working Group Team</strong> Co-Lead, is also eager to resume&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/kidscamp-organizer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>KidsCamps</strong></a>&nbsp;as we return to in-person <strong>WordCamp</strong> events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kayla-Headshot-square.jpg\" alt=\"Kayla Demopoulos\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\"><strong>Kayla Demopoulos: </strong>This year\'s SOTW was a great reminder that all the pieces of the puzzle work together to create the whole. It is great to remember where the project has come from, but more importantly, inspiring to think where together we can take it.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/dan_k-2020-vign-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Dan Knauss\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-background-color has-background\"><strong>Dan Knauss: </strong>What a difference a physical venue makes! At the old <strong>Tumblr</strong> offices in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoHo,_Manhattan\">Noho</a>, this year\'s State of the Word looked like an opening at a small art gallery.  No big screen, just a lot of framed visual art. No stage, just a simple podium. And after such a long period of time without in-person events, there was Matt waiting to go up front, casually leaning off to the side of the audience (maybe two dozen people) a few feet away. There were some awkward (but good!) moments, plenty of laughs, and a personable atmosphere that came through — even on <strong>YouTube</strong>. A lot of important facts and numbers were shared that we\'ll dig into later, I\'m sure. That\'s what we usually focus our attention on. But my initial impressions had to do with mood, atmosphere, and tone — the emotional register of the themes that went through Matt\'s address and into his dialogue with the audience afterward.<br /><br />We learned Matt wishes he had done things differently with the <strong>WordPress 5.0</strong> release, and I thought of Courtney pointing out to me last month how <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/news/wordpress-59-revised-release-schedule/\">the decision to delay 5.9</a> was a quiet sign of significant growth. We learned how Matt relates to the story of Ernest Shackleton turning back from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod_Expedition\">an attempt to reach the South Pole</a> only 97 miles from it — and why Matt wears a suit for SOTW. These were small things that came up in the question period, but they touch important themes for the WordPress community — growth and maturity — and maybe what they should look like. (More than a touch of humility and grace?)  <br /><br />Those who were in attendance are well-known for their contributions to the WordPress community, including many whose companies\' participate in <strong>Five for the Future</strong>. The constant and increasing importance of giving back, of getting young people involved, and taking ownership of the largest open source community effort of its kind — together — these are the mature, future-facing themes that stood out to me. <br /><br />I was talking with <strong>Matt Medeiros</strong> a few hours before SOTW, and he remarked how WordPress is paradoxically gigantic and small at the same time. It\'s a huge project with a giant ecosystem relative to the community of active contributors and what we might call the core culture of WordPress — including the people who make, distribute, and consume the news, information, and ideas that help direct the project. There\'s fragility and power, weakness and opportunity in being small in a big distributed network.  <br /><br />We\'re coming through (and possibly getting deeper into) pivotal and challenging times — not just for WordPress but the larger world of web tech and the global human community. Matt didn\'t mince words when he named the threats from big tech companies that aren\'t friends of <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/news/the-open-web-manifesto/\">The Open Web</a>. If we\'re not just spinning our wheels, the future we want is what we\'re building toward today, <em>together</em>. These are some of the big themes we\'re focused on at Post Status too, as we move into a new year.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/david-sq.jpg\" alt=\"David Bisset\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\"><strong>David Bisset:</strong> After watching Matt give this annual talk for years I could tell early on that something was different (in a good way) — but I couldn’t my finger on the cause. Matt seemed to be the most excited person in the room, along with whatever nervousness he had. He seemed more excited than in any State of the Word I can recall. Matt laughed more, and I think he went “off script” more too, telling stories and jokes. “I haven’t spoken to a crowd in two years,” he said at one point. Maybe that was it. I caught him a few times in a “nervous happy” state before the conference started. With no <strong>WordCamp US</strong> to provide a big crowd, this might have been the most open we’ve seen Matt, and I think he reflected the energy coming from the crowd.<br /><br />I\'m glad the “next generation of WordPress users” was brought up by <strong>Allie Nimmons</strong> and later <strong>Michelle</strong>. This topic <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/a-teenage-womans-perspective-wordpress/\">was raised</a> in the last in-person <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2019/\">SOTW in 2019</a> as well. WordPress market share growth will eventually stop, and we’ll need to create and sustain new generations of developers, designers, and contributors from within the community. It’s really going to be up to the WordPress community and WordPress companies to mentor, intern, and train our future leaders and core contributors. <br /><br />About “Be Like David” — it\'s the worse advice ever. <strong>(Editor\'s note: we respectfully disagree.)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cory-miller-400x400-1.png\" alt=\"Cory Miller\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-background-color has-background\"><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Gutenberg and contributing to core continue to be key themes from Matt for the project. <br /><br />Regarding <strong>Gutenberg</strong> — I greatly appreciate the work being done to make the Block Editor easier to use. It reminds me of the creative innovations that have happened since I started doing themes in 2006. I hope that continues to accelerate like it did with themes.<br /><br />About <strong>Five for the Future</strong> and contributing to core — When I was leading <strong>iThemes</strong> and as a small team, I always struggled with how to meaningfully contribute to Core on a consistent basis. Courtney&nbsp;and I are working on <strong>Post Status Contributor Days</strong> for 2022 to help bridge that gap. She’s been pinging Team Leads to ask for their wish lists. Then we plan to put some dates out and tackle them together as a community. Stay tuned.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator logo is-style-default\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile has-background\"><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/\"><img src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vertical-post-status-logo-250.png\" alt=\"Post Status\" class=\"wp-image-85823 size-full\" /></a><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left has-normal-font-size\" id=\"h-get-ready-for-remote-work\">You — and <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/business-membership/\">your whole team</a> can <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-membership-club/\">Join Post Status</a> too!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left has-small-font-size\"><strong>Build your network.

The hybrid event took place in New York City with a small audience (proof of vaccination required). As Matt said, &#8220;we had people join by plane, train, and automobile.&#8221; Those who didn’t make the trek to the live event watched the livestream from wherever they call home, all around the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was an exciting moment for the WordPress community which also celebrated its first in-person WordCamp in Sevilla, Spain, after a lengthy hiatus for in-person events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2021/12/15/matt-mullenweg-2021-state-of-the-word/\">view the full recording</a>, complete with captions and transcripts on WordPress.tv.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was thrilling to see so many meetup organizers host watch parties worldwide. Twenty-six watch parties were held across eleven countries, with more than 300 RSVPs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to past State of the Word events, Matt covered a broad range of topics. This year was no different. WordPress’ past, present, and future were in the spotlight, with highlights on the growth of the contributors, language translations, recent release milestones, and educational initiatives, to name a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Audience members and livestreamers alike viewed product demos showcasing upcoming features that will be the hallmark of WordPress 5.9, such as full site editing, block patterns, global styling options, and enhanced image controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt took the opportunity to remind everyone of the WordPress roadmap which includes native multi-lingual support and real-time collaborative site editing. He also pointed out that anyone can contribute to WordPress’ progress through a number of different initiatives ranging from creating new features and testing to helping spread the word and educate others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt emphasized the way that open source software gets better by reminding everyone that “The more people that use a program like WordPress, the better it gets.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broader topics covering the tech landscape including web3, merger and acquisition activity, as well as the growth and support of open source software, rounded out the energetic presentation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one-hour multimedia presentation was followed by an interactive <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2021/12/15/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2021-qa/\">question and answer</a> session where Matt fielded questions that were submitted ahead of the event, as well as questions from the livestream and studio audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discover everything that was covered by <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2021/12/15/matt-mullenweg-2021-state-of-the-word/\">watching the official event recording</a> and join the ongoing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ILoveWP\">#ILoveWP conversation on Twitter</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/dansoschin/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>dansoschin</a> for review and edits! </em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 01:04:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Anjana Vasan\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: David Gwyer Teases Block Theme Generator App, Plans for a Community of Creators\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=127160\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:221:\"https://wptavern.com/david-gwyer-teases-block-theme-generator-app-plans-for-a-community-of-creators?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=david-gwyer-teases-block-theme-generator-app-plans-for-a-community-of-creators\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5020:\"<img />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">David Gwyer has been teasing <a href=\"https://www.themegen.app/\">ThemeGen</a> over the last couple of weeks. It is his upcoming block theme generator app. Piece by piece, it has seemed to be coming together and could prove invaluable for theme developers. Currently, it is in beta testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He provided me with a link to an early preview to get my feedback on the tool. This is also available to anyone who signs up for access via the ThemeGen website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the app only generates <code>theme.json</code> files. The feature was first launched in WordPress 5.8 for classic and block themes. It can have a bit of a learning curve for theme authors diving in for the first time. Plus, it is easy to make mistakes when hand-coding JSON files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dream goes beyond <code>theme.json</code>. That is the obvious starting point for such a project because it helps with current and future theme development. However, Gwyer wants to take this to another level as the project evolves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not 100% functional yet, but I&#8217;m adding features daily,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m hoping that designers and non-coders will soon be able to create block themes visually, independently of WordPress. And be able to manage all their themes in a centralized location via the app. This opens up possibilities of a community of theme creators sharing and contributing to a resource of templates, styles, designs, etc.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These goals <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-next-generation-of-wordpress-theme-authors-will-design-from-the-site-editor\">align directly with my hopes</a> for WordPress and its block system. I want to see creators actively involved in a give-and-take design community. The ideal place for this to happen is WordPress.org, but third parties can often develop these things faster without any potential hurdles from the platform&#8217;s official site. They can also push the WordPress project in a specific direction if successful on their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"using-the-app\">Using the App</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Settings fields and generated <code>theme.json</code>.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For generating a <code>theme.json</code> file, the app works well. Currently, it allows creators to configure settings, templates, and template parts. The missing piece is building out styles, which is coming soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also an &#8220;Other&#8221; section. It has a single setting for supporting the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2021/11/30/theme-json-schema/\">Theme JSON Schema</a>. This is handy for developers who like built-in validation, tooltips, and autocomplete if their code editors support it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most fleshed-out area of the app is for generating global settings. It covers border, color, layout, spacing, and typography options. As far as I can tell, it has most of the available flags that a theme author can set. It is hard to remember them all offhand, one of the reasons tools like this are helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did notice that a way to input font families was missing. He could do a lot with that in the future, especially if a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/proposed-web-fonts-api-not-coming-to-wordpress-5-9-possibly-landing-in-gutenberg-first\">web fonts API</a> is ever bundled in core WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;Custom&#8221; settings section is still unfinished. This will likely take some time to implement because theme authors can add any type of data with multiple levels of nesting. Unsurprisingly, it is not ready yet, but I am eager to see how Gwyer tackles the UI for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creators can import colors from the Twenty Twenty-Two, Blockbase, or Tove themes. Implementing such a feature this early tells me that Gwyer is likely already thinking ahead to that future of shared resources. <em>How neat would it be to pull in any piece of an existing block theme into another at the click of a button?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colors, gradients, and duotone filters are missing one configuration option I would like to see. Right now, creators can add a name. However, they cannot manually add a slug, which is automatically generated.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Creating custom colors.\n\n\n\n<p>There are scenarios where some designers might use developer-friendly slugs like <code>primary-100</code>, <code>primary-300</code>, and <code>primary-500</code>. Then, they would use names that make more sense to end-users, such as &#8220;Primary Lightest,&#8221; &#8220;Primary Light,&#8221; and &#8220;Primary Medium,&#8221; respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The auto-generated slugs feature is nice. However, it should allow for manual input too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ThemeGen will likely be a welcome resource for theme authors as they navigate the block theme world in the coming months. Given enough interest, it could also become that community of like-minded creators who are open to sharing with one another. The first step is to get more testers and feedback during this beta period.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 21:56:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"WPTavern: State of the Word 2021: WordPress Passes 43% Market Share, Looks to Expand the Commons Through Openverse\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=127047\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:267:\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2021-wordpress-passes-43-market-share-looks-to-expand-the-commons-through-openverse?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=state-of-the-word-2021-wordpress-passes-43-market-share-looks-to-expand-the-commons-through-openverse\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13992:\"<p>Matt Mullenweg delivered his annual State of the Word address yesterday before a live studio audience in New York City. The majority of WordPress enthusiasts joined the event through the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JH5PnfYg_lA\">livestream on YouTube</a>. More than 25 meetups gathered for in-person and online watch parties around the world &#8211; from Detroit, Singapore, Pakistan, and Medellín, to name a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg began by reviewing WordPress&#8217; growth over the past year, beginning with the Polyglots&#8217; continued efforts to make WordPress available to the non-English-speaking world.  In 2021, translators have significantly increased access to WordPress through language packs and active translations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>13,659 language packs in core (+76%)</li><li>15,900 active translations (+28%)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress also expanded its Diverse Speaker Training program, gaining 135 participants in 66 cities across 16 countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://Learn.Wordpress.org\">Learn.Wordpress.org</a> site is now available in 21 languages, and Mullenweg said it is going to be a more prominent part of what visitors see when they visit the WordPress website. The platform has had 186 learning spaces, which he said is essentially cohorts of people going through the different courses. Learn.WordPress.org&#8217;s catalogue has grown to 73 workshops and 70 different lesson plans. There are now two courses available, which include collections of lesson plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think this is actually one of our biggest opportunities to expand the knowledge of what WordPress is, and also define it to a new audience through these courses,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most notable stats from the presentation is WordPress&#8217; distribution, which is now at 43.1% usage on the web, according to <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress\">W3Techs</a>, up from 39.1% last year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One concern is that open source CMS&#8217;s are slowly disappearing from the top five competitors, as proprietary systems pass up Drupal and Joomla. Mullenweg said in general the CMS&#8217;s aren&#8217;t taking market share from each other but rather from the websites which previously had no detectable CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>“We actually grew two entire Wixes this year, which is a new unit of measurement,&#8221; Mullenweg joked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And to put that in perspective, we’re still 10 times larger than number two out there, but this doesn’t happen for free. And we shouldn’t take any of this for granted. There are in the history of software, and certainly the internet, many services that were once dominant that now we need museums to remember what they were there to maintain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We really need to stay humble and stay close to users and iterate the software as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg hinted that 2022 might be a year that WordPress aims for four releases instead of three. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’m proud to say it was a good year for WordPress security,&#8221; he said. More than 30 people contributed to security patches, and 1/3 of those were first-time contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Security is a process,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Anyone who says they are perfectly secure is tempting fate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our ability to be one of the most secure platforms in the world is one hundred percent a result of how much we’re going to be able to update sites because humans are fallible sometimes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"state-of-the-word-features-wordpress-5-9-demos\">State of the Word Features WordPress 5.9 Demos</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg highlighted a few new features coming in 5.9, with demos of block themes, template editing in the block editor, global styles, and pattern improvements. He reiterated that Gutenberg is the future of WordPress for the next decade:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>As we look towards the future of WordPress, we are finally achieving one of the things that WordPress set out to do 18 years ago.</p><p>This is why we started the Gutenberg project. When we first introduced Gutenberg a few years ago, we said this was going to be the foundation, what the new versions of WordPress were built on, what our next 10 years would be.</p><p>Not only are we enabling folks to express themselves uniquely on the web, unlike the cookie cutter that all the social sites try to put you into, the cookie cutter looks. We’re doing it in a way, which is standards based, interoperable, based on open source, and increases the amount of freedom on the web, which is very key, certainly to me, and the most important thing that I work on.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has just begun on its journey with Gutenberg. Mullenweg reviewed the four planned phases, which began with &#8220;Easier Editing&#8221; in 2018. The second phase, Customization, started in 2019 and Mullenweg said 5.9 will be the MVP of this phase. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 5.9 delayed until 2022, he has the third phase, Collaboration, slated for 2023, so that contributors don&#8217;t leave customization too early before it&#8217;s polished. There are only 28 block themes available so far. “That needs to be 5,000,&#8221; Mullenweg said. Later during the presentation he said he hopes that WordPress will &#8220;have 300 or ideally 3,000 of these block themes&#8221; before entering the Collaboration phase. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no timeline yet for the fourth Multilingual phase, which aims to make it easy to publish sites in multiple languages with a workflow that makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"web3-and-the-decentralized-webto-me-what-web3-embodies-decentralization-and-individual-ownership-those-are-both-things-that-wp-is-well-poised-to-be-doing-and-con-for-many-years-to-come-you-can-slide-imayou-re-really-only-limited-by-your-time-and-creativityexport-wxr-format-standards-based-wp-export-format4-freedoms-of-open-source-and-the-gpl\">Web3 and the Decentralized Web</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many State of the Word viewers were eagerly anticipating Mullenweg&#8217;s thoughts on Web3 and NFT&#8217;s, after the controversial topic was included in the State of the Word <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/state-of-the-word-2021/\">announcement</a> last month. They speculated on how WordPress might incentivize contribution through tokens or NFT&#8217;s. For now, it appears WordPress will keep attracting contributors the old-fashioned way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s message was essentially that WordPress already embodies Web3 ideals and has from the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What Web3 embodies is two essential ideas — decentralization and individual ownership,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those are both things that WordPress is both well-poised to be already doing and to continue doing for some time to come.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>He also cautioned those exploring Web3 projects to keep the freedoms of open source in mind:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>There’s been an incredible amount of innovation. I think this has also attracted some hucksters and some folks kind of hustling things that aren’t truly open. So you all are very familiar with WordPress. For every project, which is asking for your money dollars, or for you to pay the cost of a house for a picture of an ape, you should ask, does it apply the same freedoms which WordPress itself does, and how closely does it apply to increasing your individual agency and freedom in the world?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg also spoke about the many acquisitions in the WordPress space and put  them in the context of what’s happening in the world of business. WordPress appears to be a microcosm of global acquisition activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And if you were to broaden it to the global M&amp;A landscape, not just technology, we’ve seen over 45,000 different acquisitions,&#8221; Mullenweg said. This is up over 24% from last year, which is already a huge year and represents $3.6 trillion of different mergers and acquisitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is driven by another trend, which I found utterly shocking to learn and understand, which is capital inflows to stocks,&#8221; Mullenweg said. He shared a chart that shows how much money is moving from other assets into the public equity markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-call-to-contribute-back-to-the-commons\">A Call to Contribute Back to the Commons</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With an economy estimated at over $10 billion per year, and all the companies making millions of dollars using WordPress, Mullenweg took a few minutes to highlight how the Five for the Future program has protected the project from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons\">Tragedy of the Commons</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one slide, he dispelled the myth that the impact a company has on the future of WordPress is dependent on the size of the company. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Yoast has a major impact on WordPress, despite having 80x fewer employees than GoDaddy, a web host that Mullenweg seemed to be specifically calling out in the presentation when driving the point home:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>So the impact the company has on the future of WordPress is not at all related to the size of the company. There’s no reason that if we really take to heart what’s made us successful so far, that we can’t get more companies participating in the commons of what’s happening.</p><p>When a company benefits from WordPress, when they put something back into the core, whether that’s your translations community volunteering or code, as this particular graph is representing, it ensures that there&#8217;s something left in the future for WordPress to be there. You can’t run Wix or Squarespace on GoDaddy.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg also officially introduced <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/openverse/\">Openverse</a> now that the first version is live. He shared some of his vision for the project&#8217;s future with WordPress. The plan is to build this into the admin, so that when users upload a new image or video, they will be able to choose from among Creative Commons licenses and perhaps have their work indexed in the Openverse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s all about creators having the control and autonomy they need to license their content, however possible,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;And for those that choose to put into the commons, that then becomes a part of what is shared in humanity and allows us to grow and create cool things together.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also introduced the new <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/photos\">WordPress.org Photo Directory</a>, which hosts totally open imagery that can be used on any site for commercial and non-commercial uses.  Someday WordPress users will be able to insert works from the Openverse into their content with just one click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to contributing to Gutenberg through patterns and block themes and other means, Mullenweg also encouraged users to put some of their work into the Openverse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll go deeper into some of his Q&amp;A answers in an upcoming post, but one common theme among the questions was how WordPress might attract a younger generation of contributors and what advice Mullenweg might give to the young people inheriting the investments contributors have made in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his response Mullenweg returned to his call to replenish the commons. This lifestyle of giving back and making things as open as possible is the golden thread running through the message of this year&#8217;s State of the Word.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I think if you just give a person a blog, or even worse, a social media account, you feed them for a day. You teach them how to create the web, which is in many ways, in my opinion, the most amazing actualization of shared humanity and knowledge &#8211; how do we create something that lasts beyond our own individual lifetimes? It’s the web. </p><p>How do we create something that lasts beyond us? A legacy, a true legacy. It’s adding to the information. That’s part of what hopefully goes forward for future generations and then allows us to sort of fast [forward], skip all the mistakes, skip all the learnings, to what’s latest. It’s upgrading the clock speed and version of humanity.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>With the official launch of Openverse and the continued growth of WordPress against proprietary systems, Mullenweg was able to make a compelling case for contribution as a matter of importance to humanity — a meaningful way to increase the commons available to future generations and to be part of defining the future of the web. The vision of Openverse goes beyond WordPress, as Mullenweg said it is &#8220;something the WordPress community is creating for the benefit of the world,&#8221; with works that people are free to use on any platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think it’s possible to have an abundance of the commons,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So the more people that use a program, the better it gets in so many ways. More bugs get reported, more translations happening, more plugins get developed, more themes get developed.&#8221; This is one of the reasons market share is a strong indicator of the health of the project and its potential to continue meeting users&#8217; needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But part of that is some percentage of the people who essentially directly benefit from WordPress, putting something back into the commons, fertilizing the soil, planting some more grass,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 21:45:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: All In One SEO Plugin Patches Severe Vulnerabilities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=127049\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:169:\"https://wptavern.com/all-in-one-seo-plugin-patches-severe-vulnerabilities?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=all-in-one-seo-plugin-patches-severe-vulnerabilities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2410:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/\">All In One SEO</a> plugin has patched a set of severe vulnerabilities that were <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2021/12/14/severe-vulnerabilities-fixed-in-all-in-one-seo-plugin-version-4-1-5-3/\">discovered by the Jetpack Scan team</a> two weeks ago. Version 4.1.5.3, released December 8, includes fixes for a SQL Injection vulnerability and a Privilege Escalation bug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marc Montpas, the researcher who discovered the vulnerabilities, explained how they could be exploited:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>If exploited, the SQL Injection vulnerability could grant attackers access to privileged information from the affected site’s database (e.g., usernames and hashed passwords).</p><p>The Privilege Escalation bug we discovered may grant bad actors access to protected REST API endpoints they shouldn’t have access to. This could ultimately enable users with low-privileged accounts, like subscribers, to perform remote code execution on affected sites.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) gave the vulnerabilities  <a href=\"https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N\">High</a> and <a href=\"https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H\">Critical</a> scores for exploitability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Montpas explained that All In One SEO failed to secure the plugin&#8217;s REST API endpoints, allowing users with low-privileged accounts (such as subscribers) to bypass the privilege checks and gain access to every endpoint the plugin registers. This includes a particularly sensitive <code>htaccess</code> endpoint, which is capable rewriting a site’s .htaccess file with arbitrary content. Montpas said an attacker could abuse this feature to hide <a href=\"https://github.com/wireghoul/htshells\">.htaccess backdoors</a> and execute malicious code on the server.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in One SEO is active on more than 3 million WordPress sites, and every version of the plugin between 4.0.0 and 4.1.5.2 is affected and vulnerable. Users with automatic updates enabled for minor releases should already have the patch since it was released six days ago. For those who are updating manually, the Jetpack Scan team recommends users within the affected range update to the latest version as soon as possible. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 03:08:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"WPTavern: Alara Block Theme Promises a New Pattern or Design Variation Every Week for the Next Year\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=126282\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:243:\"https://wptavern.com/alara-block-theme-promises-a-new-pattern-or-design-variation-every-week-for-the-next-year?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=alara-block-theme-promises-a-new-pattern-or-design-variation-every-week-for-the-next-year\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4556:\"<img />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">One month ago, UXL Themes released <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/alara/\">Alara</a>. It was a theme that carried with it one bold promise: every week for the next year, users could expect a new design variation, child theme, or block pattern. And, all of this would be done on the back of the block theme system that is slated to launch with WordPress 5.9 next month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from one part-time member of the support crew, Andrew Starr is the sole developer for <a href=\"https://uxlthemes.com/\">UXL Themes</a>. With the promise, he put a whole lot of creative work on his shoulders for most of 2022. Alara already has 41 block patterns and one child theme available. Presumably, he will ship <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/skins-are-back-in-style-proposal-for-themes-to-bundle-user-selectable-design-variations\">global style variations</a> when the feature lands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alara is the third block theme by UXL Themes. In February, I covered the first, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/build-a-full-wordpress-site-via-block-patterns-with-the-hansen-theme\">Hansen</a>. Block theming was still in its infancy at the time. The system has matured, and Starr has built some experience on top of it. It shows with his latest outing. And, for this theme, he has thus far kept up with his plan to offer new features every week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not the biggest fan of the theme&#8217;s default typography. The font-size and line-height work well enough for long-form content. However, its light font-weight can make text tough to read. The great thing about block themes is that they integrate with the site editor. Users who prefer a thicker weight only need to select it via the Typography panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Changing the theme&#8217;s default font-weight.\n\n\n\n<p>What Alara does well is offer a large selection of patterns for its users. I will sound like a broken record here, but this is how themes will differentiate themselves from others in the block-theming paradigm. If users can essentially overwrite anything about the design, the value-add is all the extras themers offer to them. Right now, that is in the form of patterns and block styles. Eventually, global style variations will be included in that list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alara initially launched with 29 patterns, but Starr has added 12 more since then. They are broken down into 13 categories. One of those is an &#8220;Alara &#8211; New&#8221; category, which showcases the latest patterns bundled with the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Latest patterns bundled with the theme.\n\n\n\n<p>I like this approach to letting users know what is new with the theme. Since WordPress has no built-in way for theme authors to highlight new features, I expect to see more theme authors take similar approaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The patterns cover a range of use cases. The latest release includes some new recipe patterns for food bloggers. It includes business-friendly layouts for pricing tables, reviews, and call-to-action sections. Plus, it has several more for general-purpose use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of my favorites are the &#8220;About&#8221; patterns. There are layouts for both single site owners and teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />&#8220;Team 3&#8221; block pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>The theme also offers two full-page patterns. Users can insert them and instantly have an editable page with filled-in content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such patterns often take up a lot of room in the inserter when opened as a sidebar. They are better viewed in the full-screen pattern explorer overlay.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Full-page patterns.\n\n\n\n<p>I would still like to see WordPress officially adopt the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/full-page-patterns-are-still-the-missing-piece-of-block-wordpress-theme-development\">starter page templates system</a> or something similar to handle these use cases. Many users will rather insert a full page of content instead of piecing it together with smaller patterns. They should have a dedicated section in the UI for easy access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For users who prefer brighter and bolder color choices over Alara&#8217;s more vintage default design, UXL Themes has also released a child theme named <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/ceres/\">Ceres</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alara could be a solid block theme for those eager to tinker with WordPress 5.9 features. There are still a few quirks, depending on which version of the Gutenberg plugin (or beta version of WordPress 5.9) is in use. I am excited to see if Starr keeps up with the promise of weekly design and pattern releases over the next year.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 02:12:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.9 Beta 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11835\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/12/wordpress-5-9-beta-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5913:\"<p>WordPress 5.9 Beta 3 is now available for testing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software version is still under development.</strong> Please do not run this software on a production site; install it on a test site, where you can try out the newest features and get a feel for how they will work on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the WordPress 5.9 Beta 3 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Install and activate the<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\"> <strong>WordPress Beta Tester</strong></a><strong> </strong>plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Direct download <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.9-beta3.zip\">the beta version</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> If you use WP-CLI to upgrade from Beta 1 or Beta 2 to Beta 3 on a case-insensitive filesystem, please use the following command sequence:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Command One:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>wp core update --version=5.9-beta2</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Command Two:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>wp core update --version=5.9-beta3 --force</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The current target for the final release of 5.9 is January 25, 2022, which gets closer every minute.

Automattic hired key members of the CC Search team in support of its continued development and sponsors their contributions to the project as part of the company’s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/automattic/\">Five for the Future commitment</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond hosting the search engine, adding Openverse searching and image downloading is on the roadmap for WordPress core. When asked in the comments of his blog if the WordPress media library can be integrated with Opeverse, Mullenweg <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2021/04/cc-search-to-join-wordpress-org/#comment-590381\">confirmed</a> that is the plan. Users may also be able to share their own works back to the commons in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2021/08/30/open-minds-podcast-matt-mullenweg-of-automattic/\">episode</a> of the Open Minds podcast published in August, Mullenweg elaborated on one of the motivations behind bringing Creative Commons Search into WordPress. In the early days of WordPress, GPL-compatible images were not easy to find. Mullenweg said he had even shared his personal collection of 30,000 photographs as open works that anyone could use for designs and themes, to spur on creativity when CC0 images were more scarce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I also really want to make it easy for people within WordPress to license their images in a way they can be accessible to others,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s exciting to know that there&#8217;s going to be open-source-compatible images across any number of sites, to any number of people building things for the web, whether that&#8217;s on WordPress or something else.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg is expected to speak more about Openverse at his annual <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2021-will-be-broadcast-live-from-new-york-city-on-december-14\">State of the Word address</a> tomorrow, which will stream live from New York City with a small studio audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested to contribute to the maintenance and the  future of the Openverse project, you can connect with the team at <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/openverse/\">make.worpress.org/openverse</a> or in the #openverse channel on WordPress Slack.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 04:30:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: The Next Generation of WordPress Theme Authors Will Design From the Site Editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=126691\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:223:\"https://wptavern.com/the-next-generation-of-wordpress-theme-authors-will-design-from-the-site-editor?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-next-generation-of-wordpress-theme-authors-will-design-from-the-site-editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6193:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Last week, I played around with a new plugin that allows users to export a custom <code>theme.json</code> file. The project is still a little buggy at the moment, but I look forward to covering it in more detail soon. The export function was more of a secondary objective for the plugin, but it represents a feature I look forward to landing in WordPress one day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While tinkering with the plugin, I reminded myself to check on the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/27528\">progress of a related ticket</a> for Gutenberg. Currently, the site editor feature allows end-users to export their theme templates. However, there is still no way to do so for global styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, block themes need two components: templates and a global styles configuration. There are other pieces. The <code>functions.php</code> file is increasingly unnecessary, and the standard <code>style.css</code> file is often used for adding theme data instead of CSS. There is talk of adding both <code>/patterns</code> and <code>/styles</code> folder support for automatically registering block patterns and global style variations, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Twenty Twenty-Two theme folder and file structure.\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress theme development already looks different than it did just a few years ago. Soon, old-school themers will hardly recognize it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is not necessarily a bad thing. The ongoing mantra is that the platform seeks to democratize design much as it did for publishing. I have often wondered how feasible such a goal really was. I would see sparks of genius littered throughout the project in the past few years. It took a while for all the moving parts to become a well-oiled machine. There are still some missing components, but the platform&#8217;s promise is becoming a reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-neutral-200-background-color has-neutral-200-color is-style-tavern-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Over the weekend, I happened across an old friend&#8217;s Facebook profile. He is one of the few bloggers I began following in the early 2000s. I noticed he had shared something from his blog, and I checked it out. He has a background in journalism, and he has always had unique insights into what most of us might consider the mundane, day-to-day life stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I continued reading other posts. It was a welcome change of pace to pour through thoughts from someone who is simply blogging for the sake of blogging, even if still on Blogger and not WordPress. The site does not look any different than it did years ago. He even has a blogroll. I spent about an hour going from site to site, reading the ramblings of other passionate bloggers, most of them on the self-hosted WordPress software or WordPress.com. It was a reminder of why we continue building this platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we all have different reasons for coming to the same place. We must also have a healthy economy behind WordPress, which helps fund the project&#8217;s more altruistic mission. At the end of the day, the goal is to provide free software for the masses, offering an alternative to the gatekeepers and walled gardens elsewhere on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme design needed to be shaken up. I enjoy finding the odd diamond in the rough. But, it has been a long time since the average end-user has had true freedom with their website&#8217;s design. Kubrick was fine in the mid-2000s. WordPress catered to a DIY crowd that was OK with making CSS changes to get their desired outcome. However, in the 2020s, the platform must bring a new set of tools to a wide-ranging audience. That is what the global styles feature is all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-neutral-200-background-color has-neutral-200-color is-style-tavern-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">When WordPress 5.9 launches next month, many users will get a taste of the site editor. Users who switch over to the upcoming Twenty Twenty-Two theme will have more design power at their fingertips than ever before with stock WordPress. From templates to styles, they will change the front end of their sites to whatever they dream up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some will undoubtedly stumble upon the &#8220;Export&#8221; button in the site editor:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Exporting the site&#8217;s templates.\n\n\n\n<p>It is a handy tool for theme authors transitioning to block theme development, but that little button has a world of potential. Right now, it spits out an <code>edit-site-editor.zip</code> file with a <code>/theme</code> sub-folder. Within that, sits <code>/templates</code> and <code>/parts</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is missing is the <code>theme.json</code> file, which represents the global styles. When that lands, users will essentially be exporting an entire theme. Well, minus a screenshot and required legacy files like <code>style.css</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of democratizing design is not just handing over the ability to customize the site. Fulfilling the mission means people can share those designs. The next generation of WordPress themers will not be stuck in a code editor like those of us today. They will cut their teeth on the built-in site editor. Some will graduate to more advanced development, but others will have everything they need to publish their themes on WordPress.org or even venture out and build their own businesses. In part, it will level the playing field for those with an eye for design but not the coding chops to create those projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exporting global styles cannot get here fast enough. Then, we need to add pattern exports to the equation, but the mission requires we take it one more step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I look forward to the day when a user can build an entire theme from scratch in WordPress. Then, they submit it to the theme directory without writing a bit of code. Could one of those &#8220;average&#8221; bloggers find a talent for web design they never knew they had? Could someone who always wanted to learn but did not have the time/resources/privilege create the next most popular theme? I like to think so.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 00:37:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 10.0.0-beta1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=322432\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"https://buddypress.org/2021/12/buddypress-10-0-0-beta1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5913:\"<p><strong>BuddyPress 10.0.0-beta1</strong> is finally available for testing! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f384.png\" alt=\"🎄\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please note the plugin is <strong>still in development</strong>, so we recommend running this beta release on a <strong>testing site</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test <a href=\"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/buddypress.10.0.0-beta1.zip\">BuddyPress 10.0.0-beta1</a> in 4 ways :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Try the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-beta-tester/\">BP Beta Tester</a> plugin.</li><li><a href=\"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/buddypress.10.0.0-beta1.zip\">Download the beta here</a><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/buddypress.8.0.0-beta1.zip\" target=\"_blank\"> (zip file)</a>.</li><li>Check out our SVN repository: <code>svn co https://buddypress.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/</code></li><li>Clone our read-only Git repository: <code>git clone git://buddypress.git.wordpress.org/</code></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The current target for final release is early next year : January 5, 2022.

This week, he wrote a tutorial on <a href=\"https://richtabor.com/pattern-block/\"><strong>Building WordPress Block Themes with the New Gutenberg Pattern Block</strong></a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pattern block renders a pattern — typically used within a template from a block theme. The main advantage is that it allows for translatable templates in themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dgwyer\">David Gwyer</a></strong> has been working on a <strong><a href=\"https://themegen.app\">Block Theme Generator</a></strong>&nbsp;and the first version is already online. It offers HTML form and some tools to select all the settings you would want to configure for your theme in the theme.json file, assembles it and lets you download the file to add to your theme. It&#8217;s a first version, but already quite nifty. I, for one, had great fun playing around with the color pickers for all kind of features. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />Screenshot: <a href=\"https://themegen.app\">Block Theme Generator by David Gwyer.</a>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>On a side note, <strong>Ryan Welcher</strong> is also working on creating a theme.json generating tool within the block editor.

id=\"transcript\"><strong>Transcript</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, hello and welcome to our 57th episode of the Gutenberg Changelog podcast. In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 12.1 release, block theme.json builders and WordPress 5.9 Beta 2, and Twitter Spaces. I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times, and Developer Advocate at Automattic. And I&#8217;m here with my co-host Grzegorz Ziolkowski, JavaScript developer at Automattic and WordPress core contributor. So how are you today, Grzegorz?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Oh, thank you, I&#8217;m great. Winter is already in Poland. We have a tons of snow outside, so we were outside with my daughter today doing angels. That was fun, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowsk</em>i: It&#8217;s pretty surprising that it&#8217;s so early, because usually it&#8217;s in January. Anyway, how is it at your place? How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, in Florida, it&#8217;s really warm. It&#8217;s 70 degrees Celsius, so I&#8217;m not going to complain about anything. And I just got back from Germany where it was really cold and I got to test all my winter clothes configurations, and yeah, it was end to end testing and it worked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Thank you, all good. We are prepared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We are prepared. Yeah. And we have to, because we are heading out to Vancouver for the holidays and visit friends. So there is going to be snow in the forecast as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so we have a great episode today. No guest, and is also the last one from 2021, the last episode for 2021, because we are going for holidays and there is a release, the Gutenberg release 12.2 is scheduled for December 22nd, but that&#8217;s so close to the Christmas holidays that we said, okay, let&#8217;s push it into January and we will do two releases with the episode 5.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m not sure if there is, will be all on, like the way you said like on time, I mean on time, like at this time of the year. So the Gutenberg core team, there&#8217;s always discussion whether to postpone some of the releases or not. So I&#8217;m not sure this type of discussion already happened and it can be on 22 because it&#8217;s just before major holidays for most of the contributors, so it should be good. But I remember that there was a time when we had three weeks between releases and maybe even once we skipped one of their releases. So it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s unclear in my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Okay. So if you want to subscribe, dear listeners, to the Gutenberg Weekend Edition, we will keep up during the holidays, maybe not every week, but definitely more often than the Gutenberg Changelog Podcast. You will learn the newest about the release schedule for the Gutenberg plugin to come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"community-contributions\"><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So today I also wanted to, we don&#8217;t have any announcements or listener questions, but I found on Twitter that David Gwyer has been working on a block theme.json generator, and I connected with him and it&#8217;s still in preview, but it&#8217;s a next json, next JS application that he&#8217;s building with a form, and then you can then download the theme.json for it. He has different tabs that you can see. So it&#8217;s not yet out, but I&#8217;m just announcing that it&#8217;s something you could keep an eye out for when it comes out. And if you are nice to him maybe, and ask him for a preview link on the Theme.json Generator. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I think it&#8217;s a very nice idea. It&#8217;s something that, it&#8217;s been on my mind as well, that we should have something like that already in WordPress core. So I&#8217;m glad that the community, as usual, is ready to jump in and accelerate all the explorations in that regard. So that&#8217;s brilliant. I&#8217;m looking forward to see how it plays out. And yeah, it&#8217;s something that we wanted to mention that Ryan Welcher from Automattic, he is already looking into something similar. I don&#8217;t know more about the approach he took in his tooling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. He&#8217;s building a plugin that you can install on a site and then you would use the block editor, the forms will show up in the block editor. So you can then do the configuration for the styles, the color settings, and all that right in your block editor. So he is also, he&#8217;s not that far yet either, but it&#8217;s all something, the two tools to watch evolve and see what is a solution that you would want to use in that regard. So I&#8217;m glad that this is going to be a thing over the holidays. And I know that John Q at one point had a site where he started something similar and both Ryan and David knew about that before they started it. But in the meantime, John Q took it offline because it wasn&#8217;t updated anymore. The theme.json schema has changed quite a bit since he started that and he wasn&#8217;t working on this project anymore. So there are two new initiatives around it. Pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. It reminds me a little bit jQuery UI. So in the past, when jQuery was everything, you could use this library for components, and then there was this page that you could tweak the styles using the controls and it would generate CSS files for you. So I think standalone apps is great because of that experience that you have call canvas for you, and you can play with everything and see how it changes. Whereas the approach of using the site editor, it&#8217;s a little bit off because you don&#8217;t have all the components presented on the page. So that might be a challenge for some of the folks to use a plugin version for that. But it&#8217;s like maybe there is something in the middle, that you can combine those two and have this nice experience of using WordPress core and having the standalone experience of the next JS app that you gives you the power of all the components that you could style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting, different approaches, to see how they evolve and how they probably fit different use cases as well. And Ellen Bauer of Elma Studio, she&#8217;s a good friend of the Gutenberg Times, has been on multiple live Q and As for theme as a theme builder, and also has a great block theme in the webpress.org repository called Aino that&#8217;s A-I-N-O. And she started with Twitter spaces and having discussions around theme building, freelancing, and she sent us the dates for her next events and she will have them&#8230; so she will have one on December 16th. And that&#8217;s on the topic after the State of the Word from Matt Mullenweg, kind of discuss the thoughts from the community there. Then on December 22nd, that&#8217;s a Wednesday, it&#8217;s probably too early for US because it&#8217;s at 9:00 AM UTC, Ellen Bauer is from New Zealand. So she&#8217;s kind of very flexible in her time, but sometimes it&#8217;s going to be a real rough thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So 9:00 AM UTC, that&#8217;s 5:00 PM Eastern. I know people who are up there, I&#8217;m not. So how to prepare for FSE and the WordPress 5.9 release, which is going to be quite interesting. And then on December 30th at 6:00 PM UTC, 1:00 PM Eastern, it&#8217;s a casual end of 2021 WordPress recap and chat. Now I would love to give you links to all of those, but it seems that Twitter Space still has a few restrictions, and one is that you can only schedule one event in advance. So I would suggest you follow Ellen Bauer @Ellenbauer, E-L-L-E-N-B-A-U-E-R on Twitter. So you get the notification for her next events. So Twitter Spaces has kind of come really around in the WordPress community. I know that Post Status is doing quite a few Twitter Spaces. Have you any experience with Twitter Spaces?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: So I participated yesterday, I mean, for 10 minutes maybe, but there was a React conference and afterwards they were doing as well, the session with speakers. So they were discussing some key topics that were covered during the day and discussing how the community fits in, all that pictures, other frameworks and libraries. So that was quite interesting, but I could join only SLD center, but still something that I just joined randomly because it&#8217;s like there was this blue button on the top with all the faces of participants and that caught my attention. So I like that. But as you said, the fact that you don&#8217;t know upfront, that something like that is happening is a bit annoying, I think. Although it has also some benefits because maybe that&#8217;s the whole idea to have it to something that just started because people exchange opinions on Twitter and then suddenly they can just jump in and start talking about the topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So I like it as a more casual way to connect with other people that are in your Twitter stream, or you are part of it. One restriction is that on your desktop, you can only connect as a listener. If you want to be a part of the&#8230; in speaking with the other people and have your input, you would need to be on the mobile app, the Twitter mobile app. So I don&#8217;t know if you said it, but Twitter Spaces is just audio. So that is also a lower barrier than a live stream because you don&#8217;t have to be on video. It&#8217;s almost like a group phone call, so to speak, with other people listening in, and it&#8217;s much less formal. And I like that part. Yeah. Oh, speaking of React conference, I think that we have the link for the recordings in our show notes, if you&#8217;re interested in what&#8217;s happening with React. Are there anything that stood out for you, what WordPress developers would need to know? I know I&#8217;m throwing that at you right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: So one thing that they are introducing new features and they&#8217;re introducing many changes, although the way how they approach it is very nice because everything will be backward compatible, so they just follow what WordPress does in that regard, which is amazing. And they had some other plans for the next major version, which is 18, that should be released early next year. And what I found very interesting is that initially they wanted to have some sort of switch for new features that is you need to apply for a whole application, however, they changed the plan. And it&#8217;s very interesting that you will be able to just pick a subset of your application and enable one given feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;ll be a few features that you will be able to use concurrent mode, those are very technical things, but in general, they are saying that your application will work exactly the same in 99,999 percent of time, which is great. And yes, I think that there will be a few improvements that the block editor would benefit from. I cannot confirm that because we don&#8217;t have any numbers for now, but I think that in terms of performance, there will be some benefits. And yeah, and also Diego Haz had a presentation about accessibility and he was showing his Reakit library that is used inside WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s an interesting part. And he also was presenting the composite component that we use in the block inserter. And he showed how the new APIs will benefit that. And so one thing that I like the most is that there will be some sort of behavior that allows you to show loaders in a very smart way. So for instance, when you show the results for the blocking set, and the block patterns, you will be able to still present the previous set of results while the new is loading and assume that&#8217;s ready, then it&#8217;ll replace that. And it&#8217;s like very nice APIs for us. So that&#8217;s very technical, very deep. And I think the block editor will benefit from that in the next releases in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So sounds like everything is really evolving. So now let&#8217;s get back to our immediate release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-s-released-wordpress-5-9-beta-2-and-gutenberg-12-1\"><strong>What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 5.9 Beta 2 and Gutenberg 12.1</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s released section in the Gutenberg Changelog is, well first, WordPress 5.9 Beta 2 was released on Tuesday, December 7th and the community is going to yeah, asked to really stress test this because it&#8217;s one of the latest releases and there are not a whole more to come. There is probably a Beta 3 in the works, but it&#8217;s still unclear if there should be a January 4th Beta 4 release before the release candidate comes out. But yeah, so we have the news item, the news page about the release in our show notes. And it gives you great instructions on how you can test things, especially the bug fixes that came in late there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us to the Gutenberg plugin release 12.1. So some of the changes were back boarded to the 5.9 WordPress core. But yeah, so what&#8217;s in the Gutenberg, 12.1? Do you want to start us off?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowsk</em>i: Yeah. I&#8217;m just thinking about that, if everything was back board, I mean, it will be back boarded as far as I understand that, or no, it might be already there. Yes. It it is already, sorry. I had to think how the process goes and because we are using RC of the plugin when we start cherry picking comments. So that&#8217;s like already happened this week on Monday and yeah. So I think the biggest change is that one of the blockers that was right during the time when the release date was postponed, was the experience around picking templates. And now we have a separate page for templates and it contains the list view, that contains the name and the source of the template, whether it comes from the team or maybe whether that was created by the one of the users from the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that shows the list, and on the same screen, there is also a new button that is on the top right side. And it allows you to create a missing template. So let&#8217;s say you don&#8217;t have a 404 page provided by the theme, and you can just use button to create that one, that experience. Yeah. I mean, it&#8217;s like that&#8217;s the biggest change. That was something that was missing. I mean, that was in the plugin to work different in a different way. So there was a sidebar on the left side that allows you to do all those things. However, I don&#8217;t know. Do you remember why it was not included?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"enhancements\"><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It was in 5.8. There was a template section in the right hand sidebar. Yes. But that was because the full site editor didn&#8217;t have all the right workflow. So you are only able to edit the template that you were on though, the post or the page template, but now they have this under appearance, the additional menu. And that&#8217;s where you can look at templates as well as template parts. It&#8217;s a separate menu. And that is now available for WordPress 5.9. Another big change is, or what was missing, was that in the site editor, you were able to add blocks as well as block patterns. But now you also can add reusable blocks that you already built to add them to a template. So that was a missing piece right there. And I&#8217;m glad that&#8217;s in there now for 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I think that for sure was overlooked at some point, because there&#8217;s so many features already in the post content editor that it wasn&#8217;t so easy to bring them to the site editor and it was like, each feature needs to be also evaluated, whether it makes sense in that context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I can understand that, yeah, that some features are not finished until they are evaluated for a broader usage. Like if it works in a post edit, it doesn&#8217;t mean it works that way in the site editor, so some things need to change to actually make it work for the site editor, which also kind of updates the UI or something like that. So it&#8217;s quite a complex system that is back and forth from new features to old features, to new features kind of way. It&#8217;s almost like a feedback loop that you also have with users, and you introduced few new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, in the global styles now it&#8217;s also possible to opt out of the default palette for the interface. So if a theme and theme JSON opts out in the default colors for a site, then those colors are not shown in the site editor sidebar, which, yeah, certainly that was a big complaint that people said, well, I don&#8217;t want users to actually be using those colors. But on the other hand, you need those colors when there is no color palette from the theme. So it, yeah, it kind of offers something, yeah. So it&#8217;s kind of an interesting problem to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. But I guess the stats, they still exist because you could change teams and you could be using one of those core colors. So they need to be there in case you use them in one of the overridden templates or template parts, or reusable blocks or whatever. But yeah, I think also on the feature section, it&#8217;s something that is more like a developer experience. So we were talking about the schemas for theme.json that helps developers and designers when they building their teams have this hints, what given property could be, or just showing the list of possibilities. And there was change other that allows to use custom blocks. So not only the core blocks, but if you have a custom block and you could apply some style changes and do the hints, because it&#8217;s now smart enough to figure out that that&#8217;s also a block that could have some styling. So just a handy improvement for-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: &#8230;that use, because if you are not playing with the block Theme.json generators….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And that&#8217;s certainly a challenge for the Theme.json generators, to keep up with the new changes in the schema. And that&#8217;s an ongoing story about Gutenberg development that every person involved in it needs to kind of keep up with it, being theme developers or plug-in developers now, tool developers it&#8217;s&#8230; yeah. I hope it slows down a bit in, I don&#8217;t know, three or four years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. At least because of backwards compatibility, some of the existing features will stay there. So that&#8217;s one good thing, but there&#8217;s so many new features coming every two weeks. So yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And so there was one other improvement, is the position of the block appenders and the behavior of it, which is really, it was a long ongoing problem for the last two or three years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That the layout kind of jumped a little bit when the appenders come in. Appender is the plus sign where you can then add new blocks to it. And now that&#8217;s the little plus button and now you can, they are now, what is it, fixed in their positioning. And then so with the relation to the block, so they&#8217;re not underneath the block where they created those jumps and that alone is a feature that actually makes the block editor less awkward, I say, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes, yes. I mean also that helps you to, because it&#8217;s now on the bottom right side of the space that the block occupies, the parent blocks that can have blocks inside, which is really good because you exactly know where are you adding this block. Whereas before the plus sign was in many cases it was positioned in a way that you weren&#8217;t sure whether that goes to the block you want to add or just is outside. So yeah. I like that a lot. I must admit when I saw that for the first time I was a bit lost. I didn&#8217;t know what this icon is all about. I was thinking that something is misplaced, but once you learn how it works now, it&#8217;s so much better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. I totally agree. Yeah. Good job everyone. And there is now a keyboard shortcut to double escape unselected blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: No, no. So you need to press escape twice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: So because now alt select all blocks, whereas one escape just makes you go out on the edit mode. So it goes outside of the single block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> So it just….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Does that take care of, sometimes it happens that I&#8217;m not getting out of select. I cannot edit things. And is that….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, because we have two modes. One is for browsing. I know, it&#8217;s like, what&#8217;s the name, but the idea, yeah. The one is that it&#8217;s for accessibility. When you are contained in a blog that you are editing and then when you tap, it goes to the sidebar. And when you tap it just go to the toolbar, like there&#8217;s a cycle inside the single block, whereas when you escape and you can just use arrow up down just to navigate between blocks. So that makes you faster to move between blocks if you are using keyboard a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So I&#8217;m going to test this out over the weekend when I do the weekend edition, because that&#8217;s where I sometimes got trapped and I got out of it by just reloading the page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: When you keep press enter, then you go again in the edit mode so that&#8217;s&#8230; You need to learn some of those shortcuts and just use mouse and&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So the next thing is adjust the order of theme blocks and reorder the inserted items, the inserter items, sorry. And that has to do with the site editor and the theme blocks that are available. So the order is adjusted so you might find it on a different spot if you have been testing this before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: There are now so many theme blocks and you know, some of them aren&#8217;t that important. so that&#8217;s why you can see now, like on the top of that is the navigation block or site title, site logo, or the logo that you would rather prefer to use when you start thinking about building the design for your template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And also, so it&#8217;s more the, oh, I did not know that it was actually a login logout block there. I just saw that because it&#8217;s now on the top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah. Awesome. Yeah. What&#8217;s next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. In the block library, there is now a new block, which is comments pagination blocks. So just to explain, there is now an ongoing quark on the comments query loop, which is like more or less the same concept, like query loop, which is a technical name for the list of posts or pages or whatever post type you pick. And the idea is to replicate the same capability for designing how comments look and that pagination is one of the things that you can have with comments in the classic themes. So it&#8217;s there and the next and previous blocks for the pagination are missing still, but they should land soon. So in general, this comment square look, I would consider that very experimental in the WordPress 5.9. There will be a different block that is just wrapped around on the comment form or comment template. I don&#8217;t remember the name, but it&#8217;s just the PHP function that does everything for you and shows you the comments that you see on the single post page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Okay, cool. Yeah. So the comments pagination block and all the other single comments blocks that are in the works, or have been released with the plugin will be in WordPress 6.0, because it&#8217;s still all experimental.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes. I mean, if everything is done, which is most likely, yes.<em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. All right. So then there were some updates on the navigation block and now it shows its changes to the sub menu options to show an error button when relevant and then implement suitable fallback to a navigation block on the front end when there is no menu yet selected. That was something that the team experimented with quite a bit, and there are four or five PRs that are related to that. It certainly is&#8230; that&#8217;s part of the backwards compatibility also for the navigation block that if there is no menu, because it&#8217;s a new site, yeah, you still can use the navigation block and get hints on that. But it also shows you a fall back. I tested this and it was quite interesting to see that it kind of took over and showed me all the pages if I wanted to, the navigation block is coming along quite nicely. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I think they also added PHP filter in case someone doesn&#8217;t like the default behavior for the fallback. So you can opt out with that. The filter name is block under score core underscore navigation underscore render underscore fallback, quite long one. And yeah. And basically you can just opt out or just provide your own way of doing that, which is pretty nice. And also there&#8217;s a technical change, which is less important, but they decided that instead of having the navigation menu ID attribute, there will be a ref which is aligned with how usable blocks work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bug-fixes\"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. Yeah. So next item that we want to point out is the template part block that when you convert it to a reusable block, it kind of removes the color space and layout options of the template block. That&#8217;s very interesting to kind of test out if on&#8230; I&#8217;m kind of wondering, the interesting part is because I&#8217;m wondering about the use case for that, but I think the more you use it, the more you kind of understand it much better, then there is a change to the gallery block. That&#8217;s the refactored gallery block. And now they turned on the auto migration from our version one gallery block to our version two format when the post is edited. So that&#8217;s quite nice so you don&#8217;t have to physically do anything when you open up a post or a page that has a previous gallery version. It automatically converts it to the gallery version that has each image as an image block and uses the inner block. So you have all the features of an image block also available to your gallery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting. Although, I guess you still need to save it just to make sure that the version two is stored in the database. Although if you don&#8217;t change anything, that&#8217;s probably not that important. So, I mean, when you don&#8217;t change anything in the gallery, so you probably don&#8217;t have to save it. I haven&#8217;t tested that yet. I&#8217;m just wondering whether the save button just immediately marks itself as actionable, but you need to do something, whether just something behind the scenes until you don&#8217;t change any attribute it is just invisible. So that&#8217;s the only thing that….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m glad you mentioned that because I&#8217;m going through a few tests for the gallery block just to see how it works. And that&#8217;s certainly something to test some more. All right. What&#8217;s next? We talked about this post featured image to move the width and height controls into the dimension panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. Although this, this sounds quite technical. I mean, because it was moved to the dimension panel, is like in a different place now, I mean the width and height is just better organized now. So there&#8217;s one important things for the themes. And the change is that when you are creating the structure for the theme, before you would use block templates and the block slash template slash parts folders for your templates and template parts, and the decision was to rename those folder, the old folders you can still use them as long as you use, like you cannot mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you cannot use the new name and old name, as long as you use the old names or new names everything should work as before. And there is, yeah, I think I see that you, I think that there is announcement post for that, that we will link in the notes and yes, so templates and parts, new names, shorter and better. And that is because there are upcoming features coming. It&#8217;ll be possible to have a folder for styles and folder for patterns, which is quite interesting, the patterns part, in my opinion that will be great. And yeah for styles, do you know what the plan is for styles? Would it be in there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, I think it&#8217;s a separate PHP file where you register them, and then they&#8217;re also talking about variations folders. So yeah. So if you have a block that is an image block, and you want to add additional styles, like frame to it, or a different shape of it, then those don&#8217;t have to be in the functions PHP, you can create for each pattern your own file and then have them be added to the theme rendering kind of part. Yeah. So its styles, it&#8217;s variations, and it&#8217;s block patterns that get a little bit of a better folder structure like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. But it&#8217;s far in the future as I understand it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Yeah. But the only part that is now in Gutenberg is the renaming of the folders for the template parts and the templates, because you don&#8217;t need the block in front of them. Yeah. There was another change that is interesting for those who use the appearance menu, that as soon you use a block-based theme that is built for full site editing, the current theme editor, where you get access to the file system on your site will be under tools. It will not be showing up in the appearance menu. It&#8217;s not disappearing, but they decided it to hide it or move it to the tools subheader so it&#8217;s not confused with the site editor template, editor, it all looks kind of the same. Naming things is really hard. And it was always a little odd that that was actually available for a user to edit the PHP files on your site and kind of render them. If you make a mistake, you render the whole site with a white screen of death, so to speak. So hiding is probably a good, or placing that under the tools menu is probably a good decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. So I just wanted to also mention from the&#8230; going back to the global styles and changes apply there. So there was one thing that is quite interesting. So there was a change to the typographic panel, so it&#8217;s now better organized. So now they call it elements. So by elements, I means there&#8217;s text, but other elements can be a link. So now they are separated in a way that you can drill down into the link and see only settings related to the link, like colors, like, I mean, in this case it&#8217;s typographic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can change font size, you can change font weight, and so on. And that&#8217;s also a preparation for future changes so you will be able to register your own elements, so let&#8217;s say when you have a blog that contains a few visual parts, so that you will be able to mark that. So let&#8217;s say in the bottom, you will be able to say, I want to have special, maybe for typographic it&#8217;s not the best, but for colors there are a lot of requirements like navigation and then it can have now nested menus. So you could just start differently nested menus. And that would be like using this API. So that&#8217;s really interesting how it evolves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And looking at the PR giphy that the designers use there though it has menus and submenu, or panels and then subpanels, so if you want to change the text, you click on text and then you get an additional panel. If you want to change the link, you click on link. So a it&#8217;s a multilevel user interface now, and you need to really know where things are to actually change them. But it&#8217;s going from the top and global thing to the yeah, single element part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yeah, it&#8217;s going to be really interesting to see what people do with that and how they find things. I know that the learn team, the learn.webpress.org team is already looking at creating videos for tutorials for all these features. So I hope&#8230; it&#8217;s unclear if they will make it to the release, but shortly after, definitely. Yeah. They will have something. It&#8217;s a whole new way of editing your site. So we all have to learn how to use it. And sometimes you don&#8217;t pick up on the interfaces intuitively unless somebody points you to, well, what was the thinking behind it, you know? So. Yeah, so what else?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s also so powerful that the organization for that needs to be really, really complex, but it&#8217;s like as long as you use good workflows that are the same for every block, it&#8217;s something that you should learn quite quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Consistency is definitely key for that. Yes. We talked about things, bug fixes, there are plenty of navigation block bug fixes and also for the gallery block that came out of the testing but nothing really major.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah it&#8217;s quite expected because the navigation block is the biggest feature that is in there that was also iterated for two years. And yes, it should be in very good shape now. So I think it&#8217;s fine to have those bug fixes because it improves the experience further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So there&#8217;s one change in the components bug fixes that daytime picker is now setting PM hours correctly. I don&#8217;t know what was wrong with it, but it sounds like times are really hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: No, that one is really annoying. I think two weeks ago I ran into this issue that I wanted to post something in the afternoon, but it was published in the future, set in a few days in the morning because it wasn&#8217;t working correctly. So that&#8217;s a very important feature. So I&#8217;m glad that is fixed now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Announcement. Now you don&#8217;t have to double check your times on the publishing things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"experiments\"><strong>Experiments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And after, aside from that, there is under experiments, we find an experimental confirm dialogue. Did you see what that was about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, because the browser, I mean, it&#8217;s mostly from as far as I understand that they want to remove the confirm function. That is the one that blocks you, that shows you a big popup. You need to click yes or no. It&#8217;s like the one that comes from the browser that doesn&#8217;t look good. And I guess that is one of the reasons why they want to remove that and there&#8217;s ongoing work to prepare a replacement for that. I&#8217;m not quite sure if that&#8217;s going to work in exactly the same way, because the good part about this confirm dialogue is then when you have unsafe changes in your editor, when you try to close the tab, it will just prevent that and ask you whether, are you sure that you want to continue, and I hope that this is going to be possible to replicate that using Java script. So let&#8217;s see how it goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"documentation\"><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah, I understand. Cool. And then we come to the documentation piece, documentation PRs that are in Gutenberg 12.1. And there&#8217;s some information about the block gap to theme.json and there have been improvements to the greater block tutorial in the handbook. Well, the developers responsible for the documentation also alphabetized the how to guides section, which is probably an improvement. So you can find things. And then that&#8217;s pretty much, oh, for the tools panel it&#8217;s updated the panel and read me and the stories all have been updated. And there&#8217;s also updated documentation for the pattern block category.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I see that there are also changes to the history page. Interesting. Just there is just a news section explaining what it is about. But yeah, if you want to check something the block at your handbook, the history page, that could be interesting to learn about inspiration and like some world post explaining the block editor, and you can learn how far it&#8217;ll….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. It was interesting. We had a discussion when we were at the theme meetup that the interest in the block editor comes in waves. Yeah. And I&#8217;m thinking now we are in the fourth waves of having new people coming into the block editor for the first time. And it&#8217;s hard for those of us who have been with it for four years to kind of go back in three years and kind of think, okay, what was published back then that would help anybody now three years later to get started with a block editor? And it&#8217;s quite an quite a hard thing to solve when you have been so far ahead of those who are just coming in, to kind of think back into the shoes of someone who experienced the block editor for the first time. So yeah. Having a history where people can go back to read those posts is really good and helpful. See anything else that you want to talk about?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"code-quality\"><strong>Code Quality</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. There&#8217;s also got quality section as usual, but that are some minor changes. I think the biggest change is the reorganization in how the PHP files are structured. So there&#8217;s an ongoing effort to move some of the functions to folders that are related to the WordPress major version, because we have so many features that we still support for WordPress 5.8, 5.7, and it becomes a pain to make sure that the same features work in older version, even though the code is not in WordPress core, but yes, that helps a lot. And that help also to catch a few smaller bugs that some features weren&#8217;t fully backboarded to work with 5.9 release. So I hope that this will prevent some surprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right, well, and this concludes our Gutenberg Changelog, going through the Gutenberg plugin release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-s-in-active-development-or-discussed\"><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few things I wanted to point out in the active development or what&#8217;s discussed. There is the Gutenberg, the themes team on WordPress, they actually, every Friday they publish a weekly roundup of theme-related discussions. And this week they published the 75th weekly roundup edition. So if you haven&#8217;t followed up on that or followed that particular way, Jeff Ong and and Jason Chris picked four topics to highlight in the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so one was the new color picker that&#8217;s coming to Gutenberg. And then the online discussion on how best to add global padding and still allow for full width alignment. There are some ideas that are tested and in the post you find the links to the GitHub issues about that. And also how make the WP block style support available through the theme.JSON, to opt in instead of the functions PHP support, and then contrary to other styling, it seems that global link styles override block level styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they try to find a solution for that as well. And as always the weekly roundup has a list of overview issues for various features that are in the works like the typography tools, the global styles interface, and the default theme, for instance. And then it ends with a general resource section with links to documentation and tutorials. So if you are a theme developer and you want to keep up with the Gutenberg development and the discussions around it, signing up for the theme team make blog would definitely keep you in the loop on that. And of course we have the link in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So before we leave, I want to point out that the Twitter bot is called good first bugs, which is maintained by Ryan Welcher and it has been updated. And now you can follow along as it tweets out all the GitHub issues that are labeled good first bugs. And for the Gutenberg group, as well as for the tags in the WordPress track. So if you are ready to contribute to Gutenberg and don&#8217;t know where to start, follow that Twitter handle @goodfirstbugs and it tweets out, yeah, I don&#8217;t know how often, but several times a day, the links to those issues that are good first bugs to tackle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m seeing those tweets from time to time. I don&#8217;t follow the account, but it looks like it&#8217;s popular because Twitter somehow is deciding to show it. So yes, it&#8217;s a definitely very good way to identify some areas where you could contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Of course there is a label on GitHub, so we can also share the link to the label. There&#8217;s also a good first review label, if you want to review some code, that you can do that too. You could learn a lot by reviewing somebody else&#8217;s code. And have a discussion with the developer around it. Yeah. All right. So this is the end of our show today. Let me wish you or us wish you wonderful holidays when you celebrate that and a wonderful new year. Prosperity and health to everyone. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. I also wanted to wish everyone happy new year and happy release in January and all the best, by using a full site editing experience in 2022 on your WordPress websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes. Yeah. That&#8217;s the big feature for 2022. Yes. So as always, the show notes will be published on <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/\">guttenbergtimes.com/podcast</a>.

That&#8217;s an email address. You could also reach out on Twitter, and the links to that are in the show notes. My Twitter handle is @BPH, like my initials, on Twitter. And what&#8217;s your handle?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: My handle is G-Z-I-O-L-O so if you miss us, because we don&#8217;t record in two weeks, you can just hang out with us on Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Or on GitHub, or WordPress Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. WordPress Slack, definitely. And my DMs are open. Feel free to contact me. I might not respond right away, but asynchronous, is it. All right. That&#8217;s it for the year 2021. I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s over. It&#8217;s not, yeah. It&#8217;s still three weeks, but yeah, it&#8217;s been a great experience. Well, thanks for listening and goodbye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Thank you everyone.

It is a preconfigured set of blocks and patterns for jump-starting a media kit page for small and medium-sized publications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I first noticed the plugin, my mind immediately jumped to press kits and branding pages for businesses. Not enough companies within the WordPress space have such pages, and it can often be hard for journalists and other writers to find information. While this plugin is geared toward publications, small businesses can still get some use out of the plugin with a few changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that WP Tavern just <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-tavern-is-sporting-a-new-website-design\">launched its new design yesterday</a>, this might be an opportunity for us to lead the way. The plugin does give me a few ideas on what we could do with a similar page here on the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Publisher Media Kit has been tested with Twenty Twenty-One, Newspack, and several Newspack child themes. I did run it through most of those to check for compatibility, and the plugin worked admirably. However, I primarily tested it with Twenty Twenty-Two, the upcoming default WordPress theme. Aside from a few layout alignment quirks, it worked well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin automatically creates a new &#8220;Media Kit&#8221; draft page on the website once it is activated. The content is a set of pre-defined sections built from eight patterns and an accompanying Tabs block.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Partial screenshot of Media Kit page.\n\n\n\n<p>This allows users to quickly fill in their own content and make customizations. Once done, it is just a matter of hitting the publish button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, end-users can take things into their own hands by using the various patterns on any post or page of their site. The cover, stats, and questions/contact patterns work well as general-use patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />The plugin&#8217;s custom block patterns.\n\n\n\n<p><em>Note: I deleted a couple of the patterns from the screenshot above. For some reason, they were rendered invalid in the patterns explorer but worked fine when inserted into the content canvas.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would love to see a standalone version of the Tabs block included with the plugin. It is showcased in the rates and digital ad specs patterns, but it is so easy to create new tabbed content that I cannot help but want to use it with other projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Tabs block in the editor.\n\n\n\n<p>It could become a popular tabs solution with a few design options like colors, borders, and typography. It is minimal at the moment, but its user experience would make for an ideal foundation for a single-block plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my favorite things about the block system is that it makes plugins like Publisher Media Kit feasible. In the past, it was virtually impossible to ship a content-focused plugin and expect it to work with most themes, at least not without a lot of custom design work. That meant that solid solutions would often stay in-house with agencies with no ideal way of shipping them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The standardization of blocks has bridged much of that gap. As the system continues evolving, especially with more design options, I expect to see similar plugins in the future.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 11 Dec 2021 01:23:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"Matt: State of the Word… in person!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=55181\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"https://ma.tt/2021/12/state-of-the-word-in-person/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1629:\"<p>Update: Here&#8217;s the recording!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m very excited that <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/state-of-the-word-2021/\">we&#8217;ll be broadcasting the State of the Word &#8220;live from New York City&#8221; this coming Tuesday, December 14th</a>! There will be a very small &#8220;studio audience&#8221; of community members there in person. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recording <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/state-of-the-word-2020/\">the solo version last year</a> was actually one of the hardest things I&#8217;ve done in a long time. It&#8217;s funny, with a live audience I can comfortably present for an hour no problem, but recording that 25 minute presentation, alone in a room staring at a camera, was an excruciating process over two days and dozens of takes. I got the advice afterward that even if you&#8217;re just staring into a camera, it can be helpful to have an &#8220;audience&#8221; of a few friends in the room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even more than that, though, I&#8217;m positively giddy to see some of my friends from the WordPress community in person for the first time in several years. Please join via streaming on the 14th, and also <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/watch-state-of-the-word-at-a-watch-party-with-your-wordpress-friends/\">there will also be at least 20 watch parties around the globe</a> if there&#8217;s one in your neighborhood.

Doug Reynolds, managing partner at the holding company that owns several West Virginia newspapers, gave an interview to the Wall Street Journal, comparing Google and Facebook to last century&#8217;s robber barons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These companies are more powerful than Standard Oil in its heyday, so no one wants to be the first to take them on,” Reynolds said. “We felt the political and legal climate have moved in our favor and are ready to go ahead.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May, the News Media Alliance successfully filed a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.newsmediaalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NMA-Brief-JPML-venue.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">declaration</a> to consolidate the newspapers&#8217; cases and they were consolidated by a judicial panel shortly after that in the Southern District of New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clayton Fitzsimmons, one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs, told Axios their objective is &#8220;to recover past damages to newspapers&#8221; and <br />to &#8220;establish a new system going forward in which newspapers aren&#8217;t just competitive again, but can thrive.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The newspapers&#8217; collective suit echoes many of the same allegations of the antitrust suit filed against Google by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other state attorneys general. They make a strong case for the myriad of ways that Google and Facebook have had a damaging impact on the publishing industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/unredacted-antitrust-complaint-unsealed-google-internal-documents-show-amp-pages-brought-40-less-revenue-to-publishers\">recently unredacted complaint</a> references internal Google documents which show that AMP pages brought 40% less revenue to publishers. The documents show that Google acknowledged that its fees are very high but the company can demand them because of its market power. One Google employee explained that &#8220;smaller publishers don&#8217;t have alternative revenue sources,&#8221; when commenting on the lack competing ad networks. The suit also alleges that Facebook and Google colluded to manipulate header bidding auctions, among many other anticompetitive practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the small newspapers among the 200+ included in the consolidated antitrust lawsuit are using WordPress, such as the <a href=\"https://bcdemocrat.com/\">Brown County Democrat</a>, <a href=\"https://www.delgazette.com/\">The Delaware Gazette</a>, <a href=\"https://wrcitytimes.com/\">Wisconsin Rapids City Times</a>, <a href=\"https://waupacanow.com/\">Waupaca County News</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.fairborndailyherald.com/\">Fairborn Daily Herald</a> — to name just a few. They are doing important work, keeping their elected officials accountable and their communities informed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the slow death of the American newspaper <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/finding-wordpress-in-the-post-print-news-era\">forced more publications to go online-only</a>, digital advertising was the only lifeline for these outlets. The effects of collusion and manipulation of the digital ad market fall heavy on the already beleaguered local news industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The consolidated cases are currently pending and could go a number of different ways. Fitzsimmons said the court could select some as bellwethers, opt to test all cases for the individual claims, or send them back to the states of origination to be tried. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 22:37:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WordCamp Central: WordCamp Sevilla 2021 in-person!

I will not go into those details, but some of you may have noticed that we are now hosted on <a href=\"https://pressable.com/\">Pressable</a>, a hosting service owned by Automattic. Thus far, things seem to be going off without a hitch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For posterity, the following is a screenshot of the old homepage design along with the new one:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\nOld Tavern design vs. new design.\n\n\n\n<p>This is as much your home as it is ours. We just write the articles, but you are the ones who spend time browsing the front end &#8212; actually using the website. Constructive feedback is always valued and taken into account.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-yearlong-design-project\">A Yearlong Design Project</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">It is hard to imagine the last time WP Tavern was not running a WordPress theme that I built. Before joining the staff here in 2019, the website had almost always had a little piece of me tucked in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would have to dig back into the archives, but I know for sure it used to run a modified version of the Hybrid News theme I released in 2009 and eventually a custom child theme on top of Stargazer years later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I created our last theme in the middle of the early block editor days, and the changes over the past two years have been like running a stress test against my skills as a developer and designer. For the most part, it held up well as we ran the latest version of the Gutenberg plugin in production. I had to fix a <s>ton of</s> few things here and there, but I am happy to say that the site kept chugging along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our last theme was aging, though, and we needed to freshen up the place. We had ideas dating back to late 2019 that we had not implemented, and it is always tough to squeeze in the time for a full-blown redesign when there is so much going on in the WordPress world. Our first priority is always sharing the news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were fortunate that the WordPress.com Special Projects team contacted us in November 2020 with a proposal. Their mission:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>We help interesting people, organizations, and projects to have an excellent experience with WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It did not begin as a new site design project. The team had actually reached out about building a feature that I would like to bring back to the Tavern. That part of the project is not quite ready yet, so we will hold it as a surprise for the new year. Folks are gearing up for the holiday season, and there is no reason to rush it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team had planned on redesigning the site ourselves. We were just waiting for Full Site Editing to launch alongside WordPress 5.7 &#8212; <em>so, that did not happen at all.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After some back-and-forth, a group call, and a leap forward to January 2021, we were looking at design tiles. Our plans had changed. And that is part of the magical process of keeping communication open. When you surround yourself with smart people who excel at their jobs, you can end walking a path far better than the one you first set foot on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us fast forward beyond logo decisions, design mockups, and the constant FSE changes throughout 2021. It was a long journey, but we finally arrived at our destination of a new and improved version of WP Tavern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the Tavern to the WordPress.com Special Projects team: thank you for your work and professionalism throughout this entire process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"from-the-outside-looking-in\">From the Outside Looking In</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Admittedly, I had reservations about the project from the beginning. I look at other developers&#8217; code almost every day, and I usually prefer to do my own thing. It is one of the reasons I never took any of the dozens upon dozens of agency job offers over the years. I would be that one employee who would want to uproot everything on Day #1. By the end of the first couple of weeks, I would be &#8220;let go,&#8221; my employee file labeled with &#8220;does not work well with others.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team provided me with committer access to our development repo and used my preferred commands for the build process. It was a welcome gesture, and I was happy to know that I could change anything I needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, I have not once used any of the power at my disposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was comfortable feeling like we were in a partnership. Plus, every ticket I opened in the repository was handled &#8212; <em>and I absolutely opened plenty of issues</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Relinquishing development control was a weight off of my shoulders. I quickly learned that this was a team of professionals who knew what they were doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, there were some things I would have done differently with the code, such as modernizing some of the PHP (something that was unnecessary in the context of the project). I would have probably reorganized a few folders too. At the same time, this was an opportunity for me to learn, and I absorbed as much as I could.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from wearing my student hat, I also kept my client cap on. This was the first time I had ever gotten to play that role. There were moments where I worried whether everything would work out as I scanned an unfinished project. However, most of the time, I was able to sit back and watch in awe as the team put this whole thing together.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 09 Dec 2021 22:59:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:24:\"Gary: WordPress and web3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://pento.net/?p=5539\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://pento.net/2021/12/10/wordpress-and-web3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20381:\"<p>Blockchain. Cryptocurrency. Ethereum. NFTs. DAOs. Smart Contracts. web3. It&#8217;s impossible to avoid the blockchain hype machine these days, but it&#8217;s often just as difficult to decipher what it all means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, discourse around web3 is extremely polarising: everyone involved is very keen to a) pick a team, and b) get you to join their team. If you haven&#8217;t picked a team, you must be secretly with the other team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Max Read made a compelling argument that the web3 debate is in fact two different debates:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>But, OK, what is the root disagreement, exactly? The way I read it there are two broad &#8220;is web3 bullshit?&#8221; debates, not just one, centered around the following questions:</p><p>Can the blockchain do anything that other currently existing technology <em>cannot</em> do and/or do anything <em>better or more efficiently </em>than other currently existing technology?</p><p>Will the blockchain form the architecture of the internet of the future (i.e. &#8220;web3&#8221;), and/or will blockchain-native companies and organizations become important and powerful?</p><cite><a href=\"https://maxread.substack.com/p/is-web3-bullshit\">Max Read — Is web3 bullshit?</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m inclined to agree with Max&#8217;s analysis here: there&#8217;s a technical question, and there&#8217;s a business/cultural question. It&#8217;s hard to separate the two when every day sees new headlines about <a href=\"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/126367/crypto-exchange-bitmart-reportedly-hacked-for-100-million\">millions of dollars being stolen or scammed</a>; or thousands of people putting millions of dollars into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConstitutionDAO\">highly optimistic ventures</a>. There are extreme positives and extreme negatives happening all the time in the web3 world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, I want to take a step back from the day-to-day excitement of cryptocurrency and web3, and look at some of the driving philosophies espoused by the movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"philosophies-of-web3\">Philosophies of web3</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of differing viewpoints on web3, every individual has a slightly different take on it. There are three broad themes that stand out, however. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"decentralised\">Decentralised</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain-based technology is inherently distributed (with some esoteric caveats, but we can safely ignore them for now). In a world where the web centres around a handful of major services, where we&#8217;ve seen the harm that the likes of Facebook and YouTube can inflict on society, it&#8217;s not surprising that decentralisation would be a powerful theme drawing in anyone looking for an alternative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralisation isn&#8217;t new to the Internet, of course: it&#8217;s right there in the name. This giant set of &#8220;<strong>inter</strong>connected <strong>net</strong>works&#8221; has been decentralised from the very beginning. It&#8217;s not perfect, of course: oppressive governments can take control of the borders of their portion of the Internet, and we&#8217;ve come to rely on a handful of web services to handle the trickier parts of using the web. But fundamentally, that decentralised architecture is still there. I can still set up a web site hosted on my home computer, which anyone in the world could access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I <em>don&#8217;t</em> do that, however, for the same reason that web3 isn&#8217;t immune from centralised services: Centralisation is convenient. Just as we have Facebook, or Google, or Amazon as giant centralised services on the current web, we can already see similar services appearing for web3. For payments, Coinbase has established itself as a hugely popular place exchange cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies. For NFTs, OpenSea is the service where you&#8217;ll find nearly every NFT collection. MetaMask keeps all of your crypto-based keys, tokens, and logins in a single &#8220;crypto wallet&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Centralisation is convenient.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>While web3 proponents give a lot of credence to the decentralised nature of cryptocurrency being a driver of popularity, I&#8217;m not so sure. At best, I&#8217;m inclined to think that decentralisation is table stakes these days: you can&#8217;t even get started as a global movement without a strong commitment to decentralisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if decentralisation isn&#8217;t the key, what is?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ownership\">Ownership</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When we talk about ownership in web3, NFTs are clearly the flavour of the month, but recent research indicates that the entire NFT market is massively artificially inflated.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Analysis of 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs shows that the top 10% of traders have traded 97% of NFTs which definitely puts meat on the bones of the hypothesis that a lot of NFT trades are wash sales intended to artificially boost prices. <a href=\"https://t.co/ufgmhE2iBi\">https://t.co/ufgmhE2iBi</a></p>&mdash; Dare Obasanjo (@Carnage4Life) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Carnage4Life/status/1465811132954800131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 30, 2021</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than taking pot-shots at the NFT straw man, I think it&#8217;s more interesting to look at the idea of ownership in terms of <em>attribution</em>. The more powerful element of this philosophy isn&#8217;t about who owns something, it&#8217;s who created it. NFTs do something rather novel with attribution, allowing royalty payments to the original artist every time an NFT is resold. I love this aspect: royalties shouldn&#8217;t just be for movie stars, they should be for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comparing that to the current web, take the 3 paragraphs written by Max Read that I quoted above. I was certainly under no <em>technical</em> obligation to show that it was a quote, to attribute it to him, or to link to the source. In fact, it would have been easier for me to just paste his words into this post, and pretend they were my own. I didn&#8217;t, of course, because I feel an <em>ethical</em> obligation to properly attribute the quote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a world where unethical actors will automatically copy/paste your content for SEO juice (indeed, I expect this blog post to show up on a bunch of these kinds of sites); where massive corporations will consume everything they can find about you, in order to advertise more effectively to you, it&#8217;s not at all surprising that people are looking for a technical solution for taking back control of their data, and for being properly attributed for their creations.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>The interesting element of this philosophy isn&#8217;t about who owns something, it&#8217;s who created it.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that existing services discourage attribution: a core function of Twitter is retweets, a core function of Tumblr is reblogging. WordPress still supports trackbacks, even if many folks turn them off these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all blunt instruments, though, aimed at attributing an entire piece, rather than a more targeted approach. What I&#8217;d really like is a way to easily quote and attribute a small chunk of a post: 3 paragraphs (or blocks, if you want to see where I&#8217;m heading <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"😉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />), inserted into my post, linking back to where I got them from. If someone chooses to quote some of this post, I&#8217;d love to receive a pingback just for that quote, so it can be seen in the right context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The functionality provide by Twitter and Tumblr is less of a technologically-based enforcement of attribution, and more of an example of paving the cow path: by and large, people want to properly attribute others, providing the tools to do so can easily become a fundamental part of how any software is used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These tools only work so long as there&#8217;s an incentive to use them, however. web3 certainly provides the tools to attribute others, but much like SEO scammers copy/pasting blog posts, the economics of the NFT bubble is clearly a huge incentive to ignore those tools and ethical obligations, to the point that existing services have had to build additional features just to detect this abuse.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/art-theft-nfts\">Digital Bandits: The New Art Thieves Selling Stolen Works As NFTs</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"monetisation\">Monetisation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With every major blockchain also being a cryptocurrency, monetisation is at the heart of the entire web3 movement. Every level of <a href=\"https://web3.foundation/about/\">the web3 tech stack</a> involves a cryptocurrency-based protocol. This naturally permeates through the entire web3 ecosystem, where money becomes a major driving factor for every web3-based project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, it&#8217;s impossible to look at web3 applications without also considering the financial aspect. When you have to pay just to participate, you have to ask whether every piece of content you create is &#8220;worth it&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, let&#8217;s go back to the 3 paragraphs I quote above. In a theoretical web3 world, I&#8217;d publish this post on a blockchain in some form or another, and that act would also likely include noting that I&#8217;d quoted 3 blocks of text attributed to Max Read. I&#8217;d potentially pay some amount of money to Max, along with the fees that every blockchain charges in order to perform a transaction. While this process is potentially helpful to the original author at a first glance, I suspect the second and third order effects will be problematic. Having only just clicked the Publish button a few seconds earlier, I&#8217;m already some indeterminate amount of money out of pocket. Which brings me back to the question, is this post &#8220;worth it&#8221;? Will enough people tip/quote/remix/whatever me, to cover the cost of publishing? When every creative work <em>must</em> be viewed through a lens of financial impact, it fundamentally alters that creative process.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>When you have to pay just to participate, you have to ask whether every piece of content you create is &#8220;worth it&#8221;.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, we live in a capitalist society, and everyone deserves the opportunity to profit off their work. But by baking monetisation into the underlying infrastructure of web3, it becomes impossible to opt-out. You either have the money to participate without being concerned about the cost, <em>or</em> you&#8217;re going to need to weigh up every interaction by whether or not you can afford it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"web3-philosophies-in-wordpress\">Web3 Philosophies in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After breaking it all down, we can see that it&#8217;s not all black-and-white. There are some positive parts of web3, and some negative parts. Not that different to the web of today, in fact. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> That&#8217;s not to say that either approach is the correct one: instead, we should be looking to learn from both, and produce something better.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"decentralised-1\">Decentralised</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve long been a proponent of leveraging the massive install base of WordPress to provide distributed services to anyone. Years ago, I spoke about an idea called &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/07/02/gary-pendergast-connected-wordpress/\">Connected WordPress</a>&#8221; that would do exactly that. While the idea didn&#8217;t gain a huge amount of traction at the time, the DNA of the Connected WordPress concept shares a lot of similar traits to the decentralised nature of web3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of decentralised technologies as a way for individuals to claw back power over their own data from the governments and massive corporations that would prefer to keep it all centralised, and I absolutely think we should be exploring ways to make the existing web more resistant to censorship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, we have to acknowledge that there are certainly benefits to centralisation. As long as people have the freedom to choose how and where they participate, and centralised services are required to play nicely with self hosted sites, is there a practical difference?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I quite like how <a href=\"https://solidproject.org/\">Solid</a> allows you have it both ways, whilst maintaining control over your own data.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ownership-attribution\"><s>Ownership</s> Attribution</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing about attribution: you can&#8217;t enforce it with technology alone. Snapchat have indirectly demonstrated exactly this problem: in order to not lose a message, people would screenshot or record the message on their phone. In response, Snapchat implemented a feature to notify the other party when you screenshot a message from them. To avoid this, people will now use a second phone to take a photo or video of the message. While this example isn&#8217;t specifically about attribution, it demonstrates the problem that there&#8217;s no way to technologically restrict how someone interacts with content that you&#8217;ve published, once they&#8217;ve been granted access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of worrying about technical restrictions, then, we should be looking at how attribution can be made easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb</a> is a great example of how this can be done in a totally decentralised fashion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"monetisation-1\">Monetisation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m firmly of the opinion that monetisation of the things you create should be opt-in, rather than opt-out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern society is currently obsessed with monetising everything, however. It comes in many different forms: hustle culture, side gigs, transforming hobbies into businesses, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme_stocks\">meme stocks</a>, and cryptocurrencies: they&#8217;re all symptoms of this obsession.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would argue that, rather than accepting as <em>fait accompli</em> that the next iteration of the web will be monetised to the core, we should be pushing back against this approach. Fundamentally, we should be looking to build for a post scarcity society, rather than trying to introduce scarcity where there previously was none.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we work towards that future, we should certainly be easier for folks to monetise their work, but the current raft of cryptocurrencies just aren&#8217;t up to the task of operating as&#8230; currencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-should-you-do\">What Should You Do?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that depends on what your priorities are. The conversations around web3 are taking up a lot of air right now, so it&#8217;s possible to get the impression web3 will be imminently replacing everything. It&#8217;s important to keep perspective on this, though. While there&#8217;s a lot of money in the web3 ecosystem right now, it&#8217;s dwarfed by the sheer size of the existing web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re excited about the hot new tech, and feeling inspired by the ideas espoused in web3 circles? Jump right in! I&#8217;m certain you&#8217;ll find something interesting to work on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always wanted to get into currency speculation, but didn&#8217;t want to deal with all those pesky &#8220;regulations&#8221; and &#8220;safeguards&#8221;? Boy howdy, are cryptocurrencies or NFTs the place for you. (Please don&#8217;t pretend that this paragraph is investment advice, it is nothing of the sort.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to continue building stuff on the web, and you&#8217;re willing to learn new things when you need them, but are otherwise happy with your trajectory? Just keep on doing what you&#8217;re doing. Even if web3 does manage to <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3887767/understanding-gartner-s-hype-cycles\">live up to the hype</a>, it&#8217;ll take a long time for it to be adopted by the mainstream. You&#8217;ll have years to adapt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some big promises associated with web3, many of which sound very similar to the promises that were made around web 2.0, particularly around open APIs, and global interoperability. We saw <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal\">what happened when those kinds of tools go wrong</a>, and web3 doesn&#8217;t really solve those problems. It may exacerbate them in some ways, since it&#8217;s impossible to delete your data from a blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, (and I say this as a WordPress Core developer), just because a particular piece of software is not the optimal technical solution doesn&#8217;t mean it won&#8217;t become the most popular. Market forces can be a far stronger factor that technical superiority. There are many legitimate complaints about blockchain (including performance, bloat, fit for purpose, and security) that have been levelled against WordPress in the past, but WordPress certainly isn&#8217;t slowing down. I&#8217;m not even close to convinced that blockchain is the right technology to base the web on, but I&#8217;ve been doing this for too long to bet everything against it. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Markets can remain irrational a lot longer than you and I can remain solvent.</p><cite>—A.

Web 1.0 didn&#8217;t magically disappear when Web 2.0 rolled in, it adapted. Maybe we&#8217;ll look back in 10 years and say this was a time when the web fundamentally changed.

I think it applies here, too: if the artificial scarcity built into web3 behaves too much like censorship, preventing people from sharing what they want to share, the internet (or, more accurately, the billions of people who interact with the internet) will just&#8230; go around it. It won&#8217;t all be smooth sailing, but we&#8217;ll continue to experiment, evolve, and adapt as it changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I think now is a great time for us to be embracing the values and ideals of projects like <a href=\"https://solidproject.org/\">Solid</a>, and <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb</a>. Before web3 referred to blockchains, it was more commonly used in reference to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web\">Semantic Web</a>, which is far more in line with WordPress&#8217; ideals, whilst also matching many of the values prioritised by the new web3. As a major driver of the Open Web, WordPress can help people own their content in a sustainable way, engage with others on their own terms, and build communities that don&#8217;t depend on massive corporations or hand-wavy magical tech solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t get too caught up in the drama of whatever is the flavour of the month. I&#8217;m optimistic about the long term resilience of the internet, and I think you should be, too. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f973.png\" alt=\"🥳\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 09 Dec 2021 21:16:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Gary\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"WPTavern: Surge: A New Page Caching Plugin for WordPress with No Configuration Required\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=126693\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:217:\"https://wptavern.com/surge-a-new-page-caching-plugin-for-wordpress-with-no-configuration-required?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=surge-a-new-page-caching-plugin-for-wordpress-with-no-configuration-required\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3597:\"<p>WordPress Core Contributor Konstantin Kovshenin has <a href=\"https://konstantin.blog/2021/surge-page-caching-plugin-wordpress/\">released</a> a new page caching plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/surge/\">Surge</a>. Searching the WordPress plugin directory, you will find hundreds of caching and cache purging plugins, but this one stands out from competitors in that it requires no configuration. The plugin starts working as soon as it&#8217;s activated, and there are no options. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What kind of performance improvements can you expect with Surge activated? Kovshenin&#8217;s tests indicate that WordPress site performance on cheap hosting can be significantly improved with the plugin:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Surge stores cache files on the filesystem, leveraging the Linux kernel page cache for efficient in-memory caching and invalidation. In various load tests, Surge has shown to easily handle 1000-2500 requests per second at 100 concurrent, on a cheap single-core virtual server with only 1 GB of memory. That’s over 70x faster than a stock WordPress install with a default theme and no plugins. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Kovshenin built Surge because he could not find a suitable plugin to work well with <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/konstantin-kovshenin-launches-sail-a-cli-tool-for-deploying-to-digital-ocean\">Sail</a>, the CLI tool he has been developing for deploying WordPress apps to DigitalOcean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The biggest blocker for me was the configuration, screen after screen after screen, the amount of hoops I had to jump through just to get things working,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And sure, there are on-screen guides and wizards, video tutorials, hundreds of documentation articles, but all I wanted was a page caching plugin, not a rocket (no pun intended). I had to roll my own.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the interest of simplicity, Surge doesn&#8217;t even come with a &#8220;clear cache&#8221; button. Kovshenin said the plugin will automatically invalidate cached entries on various different events, such as when content is updated. He said you can toggle the plugin off and on if for some reason you need to clear the page cache. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If you have to flush the cache, it means my invalidation is not good enough for you,&#8221; Kovshenin said in response to Twitter inquiries about no button to purge the cache. &#8220;If you do find yourself flushing the cache every once in a while, do let me know why. I&#8217;m sure there are plenty of cases I haven&#8217;t considered yet.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked if Surge works with sites that have lots of dynamic content, Kovshenin said only anonymous requests are cached right now. Surge also forces some requests, such as robots.txt and favicon.ico, to be anonymous for better cacheability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Expanding into logged-in territory is something on my list to look at, but not going to make any promises,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tested Surge on a few simple blog sites and found that it works as advertised. On one site it took the GTMetrix Performance score from 91% to 99%. Please note that the plugin requires PHP 7.4+.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/surge/\">Surge</a> is available for free on WordPress.org. If you are already using a page caching plugin, you will need to deactivate it if you want to try Surge. Kovshenin cautioned in his announcement post that many managed WordPress hosts already have some built-in caching in place, so it may be a good idea to check with your host before adding a caching plugin.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 09 Dec 2021 02:22:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:112:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 12.1 Fixes Block Appender Layout Shift, Adds Template List Views, and Enhances Global Styles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=126698\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:265:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-12-1-fixes-block-appender-layout-shift-adds-template-list-views-and-enhances-global-styles?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gutenberg-12-1-fixes-block-appender-layout-shift-adds-template-list-views-and-enhances-global-styles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7784:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Earlier today, Gutenberg 12.1 landed in the WordPress plugin directory. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/12/08/whats-new-in-gutenberg-12-1-8-december/\">latest release</a> was heavy on improvements to the user experience, including a fix for the block appender layout shift, new global styles features, and improved templates list view. Theme authors also have a new flag for enabling all appearance-related tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.9 was slated for launch today, but it has been <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-revised-release-date-confirmed-for-january-25-2022\">pushed to January 25, 2022</a>. Contributors needed more time to refine the site editor and related tools bundled alongside the release. Thus far, they are using the extra time by fixing bugs and creating an overall better user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"no-more-layout-shift\">No More Layout Shift</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">If this was the one and only change in Gutenberg 12.1, I would have been the happiest user in the world. Fortunately, there are other nice-to-have items, but my biggest pet peeve in three years of using the block editor has now been fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block appender (those little <code>+</code> buttons) in the content canvas are now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36605\">shown using fixed positioning</a>. This means that when you select blocks, particularly those nested within others, the screen no longer bounces around, shifts the layout, or leaves gaps of whitespace in an otherwise-perfect section.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Appender button does not shift layout.\n\n\n\n<p>I know from talking to others that this has been a pain point when building complex layouts in the past. For some, they would not use the block editor at all because it was so irritating. If you fall into this camp, it is worth giving it a try once again. It is a marked improvement in the user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"global-styles-improvements\">Global Styles Improvements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Users can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36820\">define custom gradients</a> via the color palette section in the global styles sidebar. These will be available throughout the site and are not tied to the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Creating a custom gradient.\n\n\n\n<p>The palette also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36920\">shows duotone colors</a> under the same gradient section. However, there is not an option for creating custom duotone filters yet.  It is a read-only section.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The global styles panel also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36718\">splits typography options</a> between text and link elements, opening the door for other HTML elements in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Link typography section.\n\n\n\n<p>Users probably should not change this for links. Instead, they should generally match the surrounding text. If we get text-decoration or similar options in the future, the separation might make more sense. However, altering settings like the font-size or line-height would likely be detrimental to the design.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"templates-and-template-parts-views\">Templates and Template Parts Views</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gutenberg 12.1 introduces a new templates and template parts list view from the site editor. The UI for this feature has jumped around over the past few plugin versions. The list was available via the left slide-out panel in the editor for months. Then, it was removed altogether in 11.9. It reappeared between that release and 12.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The panel has now been scaled back to include three links for Site, Templates, and Template Parts. The first link brings up the site editor. The others display tables of existing templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Templates list view.\n\n\n\n<p>Switching between the screens feels slow at the moment. However, this is the 1.0 version of the site editor that WordPress users around the world will see. It will likely change over time. &#8220;The current iteration of the design favors simplicity and usability,&#8221; wrote Riad Benguella in the announcement post. &#8220;Iterations implementing client side navigation and mosaic view might be added in the future.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There does not seem to be a way to add custom templates, such as a category or author archive. Clicking on the &#8220;Add New&#8221; button presents options for a Front Page and Search template when using the Twenty Twenty-Two theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, adding a new template part is a much more refined process. After clicking the button to create one, users are presented with an overlay and form as shown in the following screenshot:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Creating a custom template part.\n\n\n\n<p>Users can give it a custom name and choose between three allowed areas: general, header, and footer. After creating a new part, users are taken to the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When viewing the template part list again, it displays the user who created it and has an options dropdown (ellipsis button). Currently, the only action is to delete the part.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Template Parts list view.\n\n\n\n<p>I would love to see top-level templates receive the same treatment as template parts when creating a new one. While there are some slight differences between them, both are templates at the end of the day. The user experience would benefit if the creation processes matched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating custom templates outside of the default list from this screen would also help designers build themes visually from the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"empty-navigation-fallback\">Empty Navigation Fallback</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The latest release introduced a fallback for empty Navigation menu block. Ultimately, if no menu is found, it will <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36724\">display the Page List block</a>. Depending on how many pages a user&#8217;s site has, this can quickly get out of hand, as shown in the following screenshot of Twenty Twenty-Two:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Navigation block fallback with long page list.\n\n\n\n<p>Theme developers can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36850\">overwrite this fallback</a> via the <code>block_core_navigation_render_fallback</code> filter hook by either returning a <code>false</code> value or a set of valid child blocks for the Navigation parent. Theme authors, I invite them to make generous use of this filter hook.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"noteworthy-block-theme-items\">Noteworthy Block Theme Items</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For block theme developers, the standard <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36647\">template-related folders have been renamed</a>. The old names will continue working, but authors should update the following in their themes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>/block-templates</code> renamed to <code>/templates</code></li><li><code>/block-template-parts</code> renamed to <code>/parts</code></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This change cleans up the top-level theme directory, but it also creates a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/36548\">path toward more standardization</a> in the future. There is already an open ticket for <code>/patterns</code>, and a <code>/styles</code> folder is possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 12.1 also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36646\">introduces an <code>appearanceTools</code> flag</a> for <code>theme.json</code>, allowing theme authors to enable support for all current and future border, color, spacing, and typography options. I covered this in more detail in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-12-0-focuses-on-cleanup-and-minor-enhancements\">Gutenberg 12.0 post</a>, which had erroneously marked the feature as bundled with the last release.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 09 Dec 2021 01:03:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Ask the Bartender: Is There a Starter for Building Block Themes?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=126654\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:189:\"https://wptavern.com/ask-the-bartender-is-there-a-starter-for-building-block-themes?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ask-the-bartender-is-there-a-starter-for-building-block-themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6328:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I read some posts from &#8220;Ask the Bartender,&#8221; and I appreciate it a lot! Thanks. I have a question now. :)</p>\n\n<p>I want to refine my WordPress theme development process, which is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>To make a unique-creative design with Adobe XD or Figma.</li>\n<li>To convert it to static HTML using VS Code with Bootstrap.</li>\n<li>In WordPress, create custom post types with PODS.</li>\n<li>To convert the static HTML in WP templates with Timber.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Based on my experience, this process is the best for me, but I want to integrate my themes better with WP-Blocks.</p>\n\n<p>So, my question is: is there some starter-theme ready to use with blocks as the main theme and later extend it with a child theme with my custom theme?</p>\n\n<cite>Federico</cite>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">This question depends on one of two things: Do you want to build classic themes with block support or full-blown block themes? How you approach projects going forward will depend on the answer to that. It was unclear which direction you prefer from your question, so I will tackle both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also seems like you are more interested in child theming. For clarity, I consider &#8220;starter&#8221; themes a starting point for building standalone or custom parent themes. My guess is that you want something closer to a blank canvas parent theme that does not have an opinionated set of default styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for your tools, I have almost zero experience with any of them. I suspect you can maintain a similar process by sticking to classic themes with block support. However, with block themes, you will likely want to switch over to visually designing in the upcoming site editor and exporting the templates. It would cut out a lot of the steps you usually take.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"classic-with-block-support\">Classic With Block Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I tend to hype WordPress theming with blocks, but let us be realistic. Most theme authors will not take that step forward when WordPress 5.9 rolls around. And, there is no reason for everyone to dive face-first into something that is not 100% on par with what you can build going the traditional route. So, classic themes are the safest bet for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starter themes or frameworks are a dime a dozen in the classic theming world. My advice is to continue using what suits you best. Adding block support is mostly a matter of some style adjustments and possibly a <code>theme.json</code> file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to ease yourself into integrating with blocks, start learning the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/\">global styles and settings system</a> (i.e., <code>theme.json</code>). It works with any type of theme, so you do not have to transition entirely over to block theming if you are not ready. This also allows you to continue using whatever setup you are accustomed to with one additional file. It has also been a part of WordPress since 5.8, so you can use it now without relying on the Gutenberg plugin or waiting for 5.9 to launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />GoDaddy&#8217;s Go theme.\n\n\n\n<p>If you really need a starting point or parent theme in the classic + blocks space, I recommend <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/go/\">Go by GoDaddy</a>. The block-first project gets routine updates, supports CoBlocks and WooCommerce, and has a large enough user base to keep the ecosystem around it going.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"building-block-themes\">Building Block Themes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">If you want to move forward and put yourself in a solid position for WordPress&#8217;s future, block theming is the way to go. Sooner or later, almost every theme author will need to build on top of it. In this context, it also makes it easy to answer your question. And, I have two options for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The go-to choice for many theme authors is to learn and build from the latest default WordPress theme. In this case, it is <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-wordpress-upcoming-twenty-twenty-two-default-theme-the-most-flexible-default-theme-ever-created-for-wordpress\">Twenty Twenty-Two</a>. It was supposed to be ready by December 8, along with WordPress 5.9. However, the official release date is now <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-revised-release-date-confirmed-for-january-25-2022\">January 25, 2022</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Twenty Twenty-Two screenshots.\n\n\n\n<p>While it has not officially launched yet, it is a solid starting point if you want to release a child theme in the next couple of months on top of the latest default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is for Twenty Twenty-Two to ship with <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/skins-are-back-in-style-proposal-for-themes-to-bundle-user-selectable-design-variations\">alternate color palettes and fonts</a>. However, this feature is not ready yet. In the meantime, these custom designs are <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments/pull/292\">available as child themes</a> that you can tinker around with. They are just as good of a starting point as any.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, you may be looking for something a bit more mature &#8212; as mature as anything can be for something yet to officially launch. Automattic&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/blockbase/\">Blockbase parent theme</a> is the easy choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom Blockbase child theme.\n\n\n\n<p>Blockbase has a low-key design that makes it easy to overwrite via child themes. It was literally built for this purpose. The Automattic Theme Team rolled out the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/videomaker-block-theme-targets-film-directors-and-video-creators\">Videomaker child theme</a> for it yesterday.

The company contends that the computer programs and source code at issue in VIZIO’s SmartCast operating system &#8220;fall within the &#8216;subject matter of copyright.\'&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vizio&#8217;s legal representation cited several past cases involving open source licenses that were litigated within the scope of federal copyright law:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Although plaintiff asserts claims against VIZIO under the guise of a breach of contract claim, that claim is based solely on rights that are qualitatively equivalent to those protected by federal copyright law. It is well established that exceeding the scope of a license by violating its &#8216;conditions&#8217; gives rise to a claim for copyright infringement.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Software Freedom Conservancy published an <a href=\"https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/nov/30/vizio-update-0/\">update on the lawsuit</a>, speculating on Vizio&#8217;s intent based on its initial response:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Vizio&nbsp;<a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.837808/gov.uscourts.cacd.837808.1.0.pdf\">filed a request to “remove” the case from California State Court (into US federal court)</a>, which indicates Vizio&#8217;s belief that consumers have no third-party beneficiary rights under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/glossary.html#copyleft\">copyleft</a>. In other words, Vizio’s answer to this complaint is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to comply with the copyleft licenses, but instead imply that Software Freedom Conservancy — and all other purchasers of the devices who might want to assert their right under GPL and LGPL to complete, corresponding source — have no right to even&nbsp;<strong>ask</strong>&nbsp;for that source code.</p><p>That’s right: Vizio’s filing implies that only copyright holders, and&nbsp;<strong>no one else</strong>, have a right to ask for source code under the&nbsp;GPL&nbsp;and&nbsp;LGPL.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>SFC Executive Director Karen Sandler and Policy Fellow Bradley M. Kuhn, who co-penned the update, said they expected Vizio held this position since the company ignored their requests during discussions in the past years. They characterized Vizio&#8217;s recent filing as &#8220;a disturbing step further.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Vizio’s strategy is to deny consumers their rights under copyleft licenses, and we intend to fight back,&#8221; SFC representatives said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to follow the progress on the case, <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/61578720/software-freedom-conservancy-inc-v-vizio-inc/\">the filings are public</a>.
